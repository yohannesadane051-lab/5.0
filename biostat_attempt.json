"stem": "A study evaluates the role of MRI in assessing the potential for myocardial recovery after reperfusion. A total of 185 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery were evaluated by MRI for delayed gadolinium enhancement, indicative of myocardial scar tissue and therefore no viability. Subsequently, the patients were followed for improvement in myocardial contractility after surgery. The following results were obtained.No contractility recoveryContractility recovered Delayed gadolinium enhancement present92 3 Delayed gadolinium enhancement absent 8 82. Which of the following best describes the specificity of MRI in assessing for scar tissue?",
"choice_a": "82/85",
"choice_b": "92/100",
"choice_c": "92/95",
"choice_d": "82/90",
"choice_e": "100/185",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "Specificity, sometimes called the true negative rate, is the proportion of patients who have a negative test result among all those who truly do not have the disease of interest. The formula to calculate specificity is TN / (TN + FP) where TN denotes true negatives (ie, patients who test negative and do not have the disease) and FP denotes false positives (ie, patients who test positive but do not have the disease). The sum (TN + FP) represents all patients who do not have the disease of interest (negative condition). According to the table, 85 patients did not have myocardial scar tissue (ie, negative condition) given that they recovered their myocardial contractility following surgery. Out of these 85 patients, 82 (ie, TN) were correctly identified by delayed gadolinium enhancement on MRI (ie, negative test result in a patient without the condition). This means that the specificity of MRI was 82/85 = 96.5% when used to assess scar tissue. Out of these 85 patients, 3 had a positive test result even though they did not have scar tissue; these represent false positives. The specificity is complementary to the false positive rate, which is 3/85 or about 3.5% in this case. (Choice B) The calculation 92/100 = 92% gives the sensitivity of the test. Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives (TP) among all those who have the disease. (Choice C) The calculation 92/95 = 97% gives the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test. The PPV is the proportion of positive test results that are true positives. It answers the question: Given a positive test result, what is the probability that a patient has the disease? (Choice D) The calculation 82/90 = 91% gives the negative predictive value (NPV) of the test. The NPV is the proportion of negative test results that are true negatives. It answers the question: Given a negative test result, what is the probability that a patient does not have the disease? (Choice E) The calculation 100/185 = 54% represents the prevalence of myocardial scar tissue among the patients who took part in the study. Educational objective: Specificity is the proportion of true negatives among all those who do not have the disease. The formula to calculate specificity is True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives). Specificity and sensitivity are intrinsic characteristics of the test and are not affected by prevalence, unlike the positive and negative predictive values.",

He reports difficulty walking and frequent falls over the last year but has not seen a physician. The patient has no other medical problems. He is married and has a 3-year-old son. His blood pressure is 96/60 mm Hg and pulse is 100/min. Jugular venous pressure is estimated at 12 mm H2O. Lung examination shows bibasilar crackles. The point of maximal impulse is displaced to the left and a third heart sound is present. The proximal extremity muscles are atrophied, but both calves are prominently enlarged. Chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly. The son's risk of developing his father's condition is closest to which of the following?",

"choice_b": "75%",
"choice_c": "50%",
"choice_d": "25%",
"choice_e": "0%",
"correct_answer": "E",
"explanation": "This patient's difficulty with ambulation, symptoms of heart failure, proximal muscle atrophy, and calf muscle pseudohypertrophy are suggestive of a dystrophinopathy. Patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are affected later in life (early adulthood) than those with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (around age 2-3). Weakness is the presenting symptom in both disorders and affects proximal lower extremities prior to distal and upper extremities. Both disorders are inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning that sons can only inherit the mutation from their mother. Because the mother's risk of being a carrier is extremely small, the risk of the son inheriting his father's disorder is nearly 0%. Diagnosis of both muscular dystrophies is made based on clinical features, elevated creatine kinase, abnormal electromyograph, and genetic analysis/muscle biopsy (decreased or absent dystrophin). Treatment for both disorders is supportive. Patients with DMD usually survive until their mid-30s, and those with BMD survive beyond their 40s. Respiratory and cardiac insufficiencies are the most common causes of death. Educational objective: Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are inherited X-linked recessive disorders. Patients with BMD are affected later in life than those with DMD. Diagnosis is made with genetic analysis or muscle biopsy (gold standard), which shows reduced (BMD) or absent (DMD) dystrophin. Respiratory failure and heart failure are the most common causes of death in both disorders.",

He does not smoke, has a normal blood pressure, and is a competitive runner. The patient is especially concerned about the possibility of developing musculoskeletal symptoms that would impact his running. He has read extensively on the subject and specifically requests help in interpreting some studies. In one study, none of 5000 controls and 250 of 5000 statin-treated individuals developed musculoskeletal symptoms. He asks how many patients need to be treated for 1 patient to have musculoskeletal symptoms. What is the number needed to harm in this study?",

"choice_b": "20",
"choice_c": "2",
"choice_d": "5",
"choice_e": "50",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "There are several ways of expressing the magnitude of beneficial and harmful effects of treatments. These include the absolute and relative risk reduction and the odds ratio. Additional ways of expressing benefit and harm are the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH). Because of their intuitive nature, the NNT and NNH have become increasingly popular ways to express clinical benefit and harm and to possibly compare modalities of treatment. The NNT and NNH are calculated in a similar fashion. The NNT is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (the absolute event rate for control minus the absolute event rate for treated patients) when control and treated patients are compared. The NNH is the reciprocal of the absolute increase in adverse events (the absolute adverse event rate for treated patients minus the absolute adverse event rate for control patients) when control and treated patients are compared. In the study, the absolute rate of musculoskeletal symptoms (the adverse event rate of interest) in control patients is 0 and in statin-treated patients is 250 divided by 5000, or 5%. For the NNH, the reciprocal of differences between treated patients and controls is 1 divided by 5% minus 0%, or 20. Educational objective: The number needed to harm is the reciprocal of the difference between the absolute event rate in treated and control patients and provides a measure to assess the magnitude of potential harm from treatment.",

"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "Women are less likely than men to receive aggressive treatment for chest pain in the emergency department. They also have lower rates of cardiac monitoring, measurement of cardiac enzymes, and ECG evaluation despite complaints of chest pain. Many women present with symptoms of atypical angina (Choice D) and are therefore more likely to receive controlled substances or anxiolytics in the emergency department as treatment for psychosomatic complaints. (Choice B) Some studies suggest that women with abnormal stress testing are less likely than men to be referred for further cardiac evaluation, leading to poorer outcomes. (Choice C) Treadmill exercise testing in women is associated with a higher rate of false-positive results when compared with men. However, women appear to have the same risks as men for false-positive results for imaging stress studies such as myocardial perfusion scan and stress echocardiography. (Choice E) Women presenting with coronary heart disease are on average 10 years older than men and have a higher burden of traditional risk factors. Educational objective: Although cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women, there is evidence that women are treated less aggressively than men when presenting with symptoms and signs of coronary heart disease.",

"stem": "A new nuclear stress test modality is tested in a broad range of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The patients' pre-test probability of having the disease is determined by their Framingham score.

The new test is most useful for diagnosing coronary artery disease in patients with which of the following pretest probabilities?",

"choice_b": "10%-20%",
"choice_c": "40%-60%",
"choice_d": "80%-90%",
"choice_e": ">90%",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "Test indication curves are graphical tools for determining whether a diagnostic test is indicated in a patient given a specific pre-test probability. These curves are created by entering the sensitivity and specificity of the test into Bayesian probability equations, which allows calculation of the post-test probability of disease for both positive and negative test results. These curves are most helpful when there is a certain threshold that the post-test probability must exceed before treatment is administered. The treatment threshold can be represented as a horizontal line drawn at the level of the corresponding post-test probability. The places where it intersects the test indication curves define testing thresholds and allow segregation of patients into 3 groups. The first group includes those in whom the chance of disease is sufficiently low that neither testing nor treatment is required (low pre-test probability). For patients in this no-test/no-treat group, the chance of the disease being present even after a positive test still falls below the threshold for treatment (Choices A and B). Likewise, in the no-test/treat group (high pretest probability), the chance of disease before the test is sufficiently high that even a negative result would not support a decision to withhold treatment (Choices D and E). Patients with a disease probability lying between these extremes belong in the test/treat-if-positive group. With a positive test result, the probability of disease becomes high enough to initiate treatment. The cutoffs between the no-test/no-treat, test/treat-if-positive, and no-test/treat groups can vary based on the treatment threshold that is selected. However, patients with the most intermediate pretest probabilities (ie, between 40%-60%) will generally benefit the most from being tested, as their disease probabilities will change the most after testing. Educational objective: Test indication curves facilitate the identification of 3 groups: those in whom the disease is assumed to be present and who are best treated empirically (no-test/treat group); at the other extreme, those who require neither testing nor treatment (no-test/no-treat); and those in the middle, for whom the test is indicated as the decision to treat would be based on the test result.",

"choice_b": "False discovery rate",
"choice_c": "Negative predictive value",
"choice_d": "Positive predictive value",
"choice_e": "Reproducibility",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "Sensitivity is the probability that a patient with a given disease will test positive for the disease. Tests with high sensitivity can better rule out a disease (SnOUT). Specificity is the probability that a patient without a given disease will test negative for the disease. Tests with high specificity can better rule in a disease (SpIN). It is important to have high sensitivity for screening tests, while confirmatory tests should have high specificity. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that a positive test result correctly identifies an individual who actually has the disease. A higher specificity leads to fewer false positives and increases the PPV of the test (Choice D). Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that a negative test result correctly identifies an individual who does not have the disease. A higher sensitivity leads to fewer false negatives and increases the NPV of the test. In this case, the test has a 100% sensitivity, implying no false negatives and a NPV value of 100%. (Choice A) Validity (accuracy) is defined as the test's ability to measure what it is supposed to measure. For a binary classification test, it is a measure of how well the test correctly identifies or excludes a condition. In other words, accuracy is the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) in the population and is calculated as (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN). (Choice B) The false discovery rate (FDR) is the expected proportion of false discoveries (type I errors) among all statistically significant discoveries (rejected null hypotheses) during simultaneous testing of multiple hypotheses. FDR correction methods are designed to reduce the proportion of incorrectly rejected null hypotheses (false discoveries) while maintaining acceptable statistical power. (Choice E) A reliable test is reproducible; that is, it gives similar or very close results on repeat measurements. Reliability (precision) is typically quantified in terms of the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV is the standard deviation of the set of repeated measurements divided by their mean and is generally expressed as a percentage. The smaller the CV, the more reliable the test. Educational objective: Screening tests should have high sensitivity (SnOUT) while confirmatory tests should have high specificity (SPIN). As the sensitivity increases, the number of false negatives decreases and the negative predictive value increases. Similarly, as the specificity increases, the number of false positives decreases and the positive predictive value increases.",

This controls for known and unknown variables that may have an impact on the outcome. (Choice A) Randomization is performed at the entry point of the study rather than at the analysis stage.

"choice_b": "1",
"choice_c": "2",
"choice_d": "3",
"choice_e": "4",
"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "The likelihood ratio (LR) is an expression of sensitivity and specificity that can be used to assess the value of a diagnostic test. The positive likelihood ratio (LR+) represents the value of a positive test result, and the negative likelihood ratio (LR-) represents the value of a negative test result. • LR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity). It is the probability of a patient with the disease testing positive divided by the probability of a patient without the disease testing positive. It is equivalent to true positive rate / false positive rate. • LR- = (1-sensitivity) / specificity. It is the probability of a patient with the disease testing negative divided by the probability of a patient without the disease testing negative. It is equivalent to the false negative rate / true negative rate. LRs can range from zero to infinity. A test result with an LR>1 suggests the presence of the disease; the higher the LR, the more likely that the disease is actually present. A test result with an LR<1 argues against the disease; the lower the LR, the less likely that the disease is actually present. In this example, LR+ = sensitivity / (1-specificity) = 0.6/(1-0.8) = 3. Thus, a positive test result would provide only weak evidence for a patient having hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease. Because LRs are calculated from sensitivity and specificity, they do not change with the prevalence of the disease. Other advantages of LRs are that they can be used with tests that have more than 2 possible results, they can be used to combine the results of multiple diagnostic tests, and they can be used to calculate post-test probability for a target disorder (post-test odds = pre-test odds * LR). Educational objective: The positive likelihood ratio = sensitivity / (1-specificity). The negative likelihood ratio = (1 - sensitivity) / specificity. Positive and negative likelihood ratios, like sensitivity and specificity, are independent of disease prevalence.",

"choice_d": "The medication causes elderly patients to fall",
"choice_e": "The study is grossly underpowered to detect any meaningful difference",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome. It represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure as compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. Odds ratios are most commonly used in case-control studies. For the unadjusted or crude odds ratio, no other factors (eg, confounders) are taken into account. However, confounding factors (eg, age, sex, socioeconomic status) can certainly affect the outcome. ORs may subsequently be adjusted for confounding factors using stratification methods or logistic regression. A fully adjusted odds ratio strips away the effects of all potential confounders, revealing the true association between exposure and outcome. In this example, adjustment for age and gender reduces the odds ratio slightly to 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.1-1.5) (Choice A). Although the odds ratio was reduced, an association between medication consumption and falls still exists. However, further adjustment for handgrip strength (a correlate of frailty) reduces the odds ratio to 1.12 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.8-1.4 (which now contains the null hypothesis of 1.0), implying that there is no real association between medication consumption and falls. In other words, frailty is a major confounder of the relationship between medication consumption and falls. (Choice B) Direct calculation of absolute and relative risk is not possible in case-control studies because the study design does not allow the researcher to calculate disease prevalence. However, if the prevalence of the disease is low, the odds ratio is approximately equal to the relative risk (rare disease assumption). (Choice D) Case-control studies may prove an association but they cannot demonstrate causation. (Choice E) Because the 95% confidence interval associated with the crude odds ratio did not contain the null hypothesis, this study was sufficiently powered to detect a difference between exposed and unexposed groups. Educational objective: The odds ratio represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. No other factors (eg, confounders) are taken into account when calculating the unadjusted or crude odds ratio. Adjustment for confounders allows the true association between exposure and outcome to be calculated (adjusted odds ratio).",
