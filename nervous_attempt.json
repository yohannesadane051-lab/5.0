"stem": "A 68-year-old right-handed man is brought by ambulance to the emergency department after his wife found him unresponsive. The wife states that her husband had not been feeling well for the last 12 hours. He woke up this morning complaining of dizziness, neck pain, unsteadiness, and headache. As the day progressed, his symptoms worsened and he started vomiting. Towards the evening, the patient was lethargic and more confused than at his baseline. He has not had any fevers or chills. His medical problems include mild dementia, poorly controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ischemic stroke due to untreated high-grade left carotid artery stenosis, COPD on home oxygen, and chronic low back pain treated with oxycontin and hydrocodone. He lives with his wife and depends on her for most of his activities of daily living. For the past several months, his wife has had more difficulty taking care of him and administering his medications properly. She states that the patient has been abusing his narcotic medications. His temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F), blood pressure is 170/110 mm Hg, pulse is 40/min, and oxygen saturation is 85% on room air. His general physical examination reveals a left carotid bruit, S4 gallop, and prominent expiratory wheezes with reduced air flow. On neurological examination, he appears comatose. Cranial nerve testing reveals absence of blink-to-threat, mid-position fixed and dilated pupils, absence of oculocephalic reflex, and presence of corneal, gag, and cough reflexes. Motor examination reveals extensor posturing in the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes are absent and plantar responses are mute. He does not grimace to pain. Which of the following is the most likely etiology for this patient's presentation?",
"choice_a": "Cerebellar hemorrhage",
"choice_b": "Enteroviral meningitis",
"choice_c": "Hypercapnic encephalopathy",
"choice_d": "Middle cerebral artery occlusion",
"choice_e": "Opiate intoxication",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with likely acute hypertensive cerebellar hemorrhage causing increased intracranial pressure and secondary upward transtentorial herniation. Hypertensive hemorrhages most commonly occur in the basal ganglia and thalamus. However, they can also occur in the cerebellum, pons, and even the lobar regions (~10%). Patients typically present acutely with severe headache, nausea/vomiting, vertigo, unsteadiness, and mental status changes. Space occupying lesions (e.g., hemorrhage) in the small posterior fossa can quickly obliterate the fourth ventricle to cause obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), and Cushing's reflex (hypertension, bradycardia, and Cheyne-Stokes breathing). The increased ICP can cause the cerebellum to herniate upwards to compress the mid-brain (areflexic pupils, impaired oculocephalics, and extensor posturing as seen in this patient), or downwards to compress the medulla oblongata (ataxic breathing, loss of gag and cough reflexes). This patient needs urgent imaging to confirm the diagnosis as well as likely surgical decompression. (Choice B) Enteroviral meningitis usually occurs in the summer/early fall and presents with severe headache, fever, malaise, and neck rigidity. However, these patients usually maintain normal mental status. (Choice C) Hypercapnia due to severe COPD exacerbation can cause headache and depressed mental status. However, it does not usually trigger a Cushing's reflex or profuse vomiting. (Choice D) Middle cerebral artery occlusion usually presents with hemiparesis, but typically does not cause extensor posturing as seen in this patient. (Choice E) Opiate intoxication will typically cause pinpoint pupils, but will not trigger a Cushing's reflex.",

He has not had any headache, fever, or flu-like symptoms. He had a severe allergic reaction to levetiracetam in the past and failed phenytoin therapy. He is currently maintained on valproic acid. His last generalized tonic-clonic seizure was 1 week ago and his neurologist doubled the dose of his valproic acid at that time. The patient's past medical history is also significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Additional medications include metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. The patient's temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. pulse is, 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Pulse oximetry shows 96% on room air. His BMI is 29 kg/m2.

Chest x-ray and non-contrast head CT are normal. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?",
"choice_a": "Check serum ammonia level",
"choice_b": "Check serum creatine kinase level",
"choice_c": "Discontinue metformin",
"choice_d": "Obtain brain MRI",
"choice_e": "Perform lumbar puncture",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient is likely presenting with valproic acid induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to the recent doubling of his valproic acid dose. Valproic acid can inhibit enzymes within the urea cycle and lead to elevated serum ammonia levels resulting in confusion, lethargy, coma, and rarely death. All patients on valproic acid who present with encephalopathy should have their serum ammonia and valproic acid levels checked as part of the workup. Valproic acid levels do not always correlate with the degree of encephalopathy and can be normal at times. Liver enzymes can also be normal despite elevations in ammonia levels. The mainstay of treatment is discontinuation of valproic acid. Synthetic disaccharides such as lactulose can be used to lower the serum ammonia levels, and L-carnitine has been shown to improve valproic acid metabolism and reduce ammonia levels as well. (Choice B) Creatine kinase (CK) can be elevated in rhabdomyolysis (eg, from prolonged convulsive seizure activity and/or statin toxicity) but is unlikely to be useful in this patient as he does not have muscle pain or weakness, has a normal basic metabolic panel, and his urinalysis does not show blood. (Choice C) Metformin toxicity typically occurs in patients with concomitant renal or liver disease or as a result of acute overdose. A major complication is lactic acidosis. Patients classically present with gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by altered mental status, dyspnea, and hypotension. This patient's lack of gastrointestinal symptoms and normal calculated anion gap (10 mEq/L) make this diagnosis unlikely. (Choices D and E) Lumbar puncture and brain MRI can be considered in patients with an unclear cause of acute altered mental status and a negative head CT, but this patient should have his serum ammonia level checked first.",

The patient had a stroke 2 years ago and has mild residual right leg weakness. Over the last 2 days, her weakness has gotten worse compared to her baseline, and she can hardly ambulate with a cane. The patient has a history of persistent atrial fibrillation and takes daily warfarin. Her temperature is 38.3 C (101 F), blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, pulse is 94/min, and respirations are 14/min. Pulse oximetry shows 97% on room air. Neurologic examination shows spastic right lower extremity weakness and hyperreflexia. A noncontrast head CT reveals an old infarct in the left anterior cerebral artery territory. Laboratory results are as follows: Hematocrit 48% Platelets 180,000/uL Leukocytes 14,000/uL International Normalized Ratio 2.8 Urinalysis Leukocyte esterase Positive Nitrites Positive White blood cells 100+/hpf Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?",
"choice_a": "Acute spinal cord compression",
"choice_b": "Exacerbation of prior stroke symptoms by infection",
"choice_c": "L5 radiculopathy",
"choice_d": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus",
"choice_e": "Recurrent cardioembolic stroke",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "This patient presents with worsening of her previous stroke symptoms due to a urinary tract infection. Acute exacerbations of prior neurologic deficits may happen in conjunction with acute infection or metabolic derangement and can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from a new ischemic event. This patient's current neurologic exacerbation is referable to the same vascular territory that was previously affected (eg, left anterior cerebral artery infarction with contralateral lower extremity hemiparesis) and occurred in the setting of an acute infection; therefore, a new cardioembolic event is less likely, especially with a therapeutic International Normalized Ratio on warfarin (Choice E). Diffusion-weighted brain MRI can always be considered if any uncertainty exists or if diagnostic confirmation is required. (Choice A) Acute spinal cord compression (eg, from spontaneous epidural hematoma or epidural abscess) is unlikely in the absence of back pain. (Choice C) L5 radiculopathy is a result of nerve root irritation, and symptoms follow a dermatomal pattern. It usually presents with lower back pain radiating down the ipsilateral leg and can be associated with foot drop and numbness along the anterolateral leg. This patient's focal upper motor neuron signs (eg, spasticity, hemiparesis, hyperreflexia) are consistent with an old cerebral infarction, not radiculopathy. (Choice D) Normal pressure hydrocephalus initially presents with ataxia, followed by dementia and urinary incontinence. Neuroimaging should demonstrate dilated ventricles, not an old infarction.",

"stem": "A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a sudden cardiac arrest. He collapsed at home while watching television. His son started CPR as instructed by the 911 operator. Emergency medical services arrived in 7 minutes. The initial rhythm was noted to be ventricular fibrillation, and the patient was successfully defibrillated to normal sinus rhythm with return of spontaneous circulation. The patient was intubated in the field, and intravenous amiodarone was administered. His medical problems include stable angina, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Home medications include aspirin, metoprolol, enalapril, and atorvastatin. Blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg and pulse is 85/min. Examination shows scattered bilateral crackles. Heart sounds are normal. There is no response to painful stimulation. Oculocephalic and corneal reflexes are intact. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with ST segment depression in leads I, aVL, and V4-V6. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows no acute intracranial abnormality. Which of the following is most likely to increase the chance of complete neurologic recovery in this patient?",
"choice_a": "Elevating blood pressure with fluid resuscitation",
"choice_b": "Maintaining euglycemia",
"choice_c": "Maintaining permissive hypercapnia",
"choice_d": "Managing body temperature",
"choice_e": "Proceeding with percutaneous coronary intervention",
"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "This patient has experienced a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Neurologic impairment is the most common cause of death following out-of-hospital SCA and is responsible for significant morbidity following in-hospital SCA. Temperature management (TM), consisting of avoidance of fever and maintenance of body temperature <=36 C (96.8 F) for 24-48 hours following SCA, has been shown to decrease mortality and improve neurologic recovery. TM is indicated in patients who are unresponsive or lack purposeful movements following SCA and should be initiated as soon as possible unless there is a contraindication. Because low temperature inhibits the coagulation cascade, active noncompressible bleeding is a relative contraindication. Absolute contraindications to TM include patient wishes against aggressive care or a medical scenario in which such care would be futile. Methods of TM include infusion of cold saline and application of topical cooling blankets. Body temperature is typically maintained between 32 C (89.6 F) and 36 C (96.8 F); however, the benefit of lowering body temperature to <36 C (96.8 F) is not clear. (Choice A) Elevating blood pressure with fluid repletion is beneficial in hypotensive patients to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >80 mm Hg and optimize cerebral perfusion pressure. However, it is not indicated in this patient with adequate MAP who already appears slightly hypervolemic. (Choice B) Avoidance of hypoglycemia is important in post-SCA patients, and target serum glucose should be 140-180 mg/dL. However, TM is more important for improving neurologic recovery. (Choice C) Permissive hypercapnia is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected neurologic injury as it can raise intracranial pressure and further decrease cerebral perfusion pressure. (Choice E) Given the initial cardiac rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, this patient's SCA was most likely due to an acute coronary event. He needs coronary angiography with percutaneous coronary intervention as soon as possible to improve overall mortality. However, as he now has a perfusing heart rhythm with adequate MAP, such intervention is less likely to improve his level of neurologic recovery.",

"stem": "A 65-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of severe right thigh pain for the last 4 weeks. Over the past two weeks, he has also noticed leg weakness that interferes with his walking. He has never had similar symptoms before. He had an unintentional weight loss of 15 lbs (6.8 kg) over the past 3 months. His other medical problems include type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has no evidence of diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. He had a right lung lobectomy for early stage, non-small cell lung cancer 7 years ago. He was evaluated in the emergency department on two occasions over the last 2 months for severe lightheadedness that occurred in the morning while getting out of bed. His medications include glyburide, metformin, simvastatin, lisinopril, and low-dose aspirin. His temperature is 37.0 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg (sitting) and 120/80 mm Hg (standing), and pulse is 90/min (sitting) and 105/min (standing). His BMI is 29 kg/m2. Neurological examination reveals normal mental status and cranial nerves. Manual motor testing reveals 3/5 strength in the right iliopsoas, hip adductors, and quadriceps with associated atrophy. Touch, pain, and temperature sensations are mildly decreased in this area. However, the hamstrings and distal muscles have 5/5 strength. There are no fasciculations or contractures noted. His anal sphincter tone is normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ in the arms and 0 in the lower extremities. Testing for Babinski sign shows down-going toes bilaterally. The remainder of the neurological examination is within normal limits. Laboratory results are as follows: Serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, Creatine kinase, serum 290 U/L, HemoglobinA1c 8%, Thyroid stimulating hormone 2.3 uU/mL, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 mm/h.

"choice_a": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
"choice_b": "Diabetic amyotrophy",
"choice_c": "Extramedullary tumor with compressive myelopathy",
"choice_d": "Inflammatory myopathy",
"choice_e": "Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve compression",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with diabetic amyotrophy (also known as proximal diabetic neuropathy or diabetic polyradiculopathy), which is a lumbosacral plexopathy that also affects the lumbosacral nerve roots and peripheral nerves. The pathophysiology is unclear but may be attributed to a nonsystemic microvasculitis leading to ischemic injury. Diabetic amyotrophy usually occurs in individuals over age 50 and in recently diagnosed or reasonably well-controlled diabetics (e.g., HbA1C ~7.5%). Patients classically present with acute and asymmetric focal proximal lower extremity pain associated with weakness, autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension), and unintentional weight loss (usually > 10 lbs). Diagnosis is made clinically and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion after other possible etiologies (e.g., cauda equina syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myositis/myopathy, structural plexus lesion, infections, and autoimmune or inflammatory conditions) are ruled out. An EMG/NCS can confirm the diagnosis. Over 60% of patients will notice improvement of their strength and pain symptoms within 12-24 months, but many may have residual weakness and pain. Since there is no definitive therapy, treatment usually involves symptomatic management including physical and occupational therapy, medication for pain control, and strict glycemic control. (Choice A) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) usually presents with a combination of upper motor neuron (e.g., hyperreflexia, spasticity) and lower motor neuron (e.g., atrophy, fasciculations) symptoms. Although asymmetric limb weakness is the main presentation, patients usually complain of distal muscle weakness (e.g., foot drop, dropping things) first. In addition, severe pain is not seen with ALS. (Choice C) Extramedullary tumor with compressive myelopathy usually presents with progressive weakness below the level of lesion with sensory loss, hyperreflexia, spasticity, and incontinence. This patient's focal involvement in the proximal right leg with normal anal sphincter tone and absent lower extremity reflexes makes this diagnosis unlikely. (Choice D) Polymyositis typically presents with symmetrical proximal muscle weakness with or without pain. ESR, CRP, CPK, and aldolase levels are usually elevated. This patient's asymmetrical weakness without marked CPK elevation makes this condition less likely. (Choice E) The anterior and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves are pure sensory nerves and their compression does not cause muscle weakness or absent reflexes.",

The patient was feeling well until 6 hours ago, when she developed a 10/10 throbbing bilateral headache associated with blurry vision. Her headache is not exacerbated by change in head position, and nothing seems to improve the pain. She denies any nausea, vomiting, photophobia, vertigo, fever, or neck pain. She also denies any recent head or neck trauma. She has had upper respiratory tract symptoms for the last couple of days. Her other medical problems include chronic migraines and non-essential hypertension related to renal artery stenosis from fibromuscular dysplasia. Her medications include topiramate and multiple anti-hypertensive agents including amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and metoprolol. She also takes birth control pills and vitamins. She has never had a seizure before and has no family history of epilepsy. She works as a secretary and has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years. Her temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 210/140 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min and regular, and respirations are 18/min with normal oxygen saturation. The general physical examination is unremarkable, except for an abdominal bruit. Neurological examination reveals that she is awake and alert, but is only oriented to person and place. Funduscopic examination reveals copper and silver wiring in the retina without papilledema. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Visual acuity is 20/200 bilaterally with intact visual fields to confrontation. There is no nystagmus and extra-ocular movements are full. The remainder of the neurological examination is unremarkable. A non-contrast head CT showed hypodense regions with loss of grey-white matter differentiation in the posterior occipital-parietal lobes. An MRI of the brain without gadolinium showed a symmetrical, increased T2/FLAIR signal abnormality in the subcortical white matter of the posterior occipital-parietal lobes.

"choice_a": "Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage",
"choice_b": "Herpes simplex encephalitis",
"choice_c": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension",
"choice_d": "Migraine headache",
"choice_e": "Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome",
"correct_answer": "E",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation is suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is a clinical radiologic syndrome due to a variety of conditions. It is often seen in the setting of hypertensive crises (hypertensive encephalopathy), chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cyclosporine), eclampsia/preeclampsia, allogenic bone marrow transplantation, medical renal disease, autoimmune disease, sepsis, and shock. PRES is due to brain edema, possibly as a result of diminished sympathetic innervation of the posterior circulation. The posterior regions of the brain are more susceptible to injury from high mean arterial pressures, which lead to increased fluid migration into the brain parenchyma and subsequent vasogenic edema. It may also occur from cerebrovascular endothelial injury (vasculopathy). The parietal and occipital lobes are most commonly affected, followed by the frontal lobes, inferior temporal-occipital junction, and cerebellum. There have been rare case reports of PRES affecting the brainstem and the cervical cord as well. Diffusion weighted MRI studies of the brain are usually normal in the setting of PRES, and therefore confirm that the abnormalities seen in the cortical and subcortical white matter represent reversible vasogenic edema. Treatment includes lowering blood pressure and antiepileptic therapy for seizures, with most patients experiencing reversal of their symptoms within 2 weeks. (Choice A) This patient has fibromuscular dysplasia, which is also associated with cerebral aneurysms. However, subarachnoid hemorrhage usually presents with acute blood products in the cisterns on neuroimaging. (Choice B) Herpes simplex virus encephalitis can present with fever, headache, change in mental status, and seizures. However, imaging usually shows a high signal FLAIR/T2 abnormality with enhancement in the bilateral or unilateral temporal lobes. Herpes simplex virus encephalitis also does not typically present with visual loss. (Choice C) Idiopathic intracranial hypertension usually presents in young obese women with recurrent positional headaches (made worse in supine position) associated with visual obscurations, papilledema, and rarely visual loss. These patients typically do not develop seizures, and their MRI brain is usually unrevealing. (Choice D) Migraines typically present as a unilateral and throbbing headache evolving over hours with photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea/vomiting. Migraine headaches do not usually cause seizures or head MRI/CT imaging abnormalities.",

"choice_e": "Vitamin B12 level",
"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "This patient is presenting with likely undiagnosed metastatic melanoma and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC). Patients with LC typically present with the subacute onset (days to weeks) of headache and a variety of neurologic symptoms/signs including altered mental status, seizure, and/or multifocal neurologic deficits. LC is most frequently associated with metastatic solid tumors such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and malignant melanoma. The usual first step in evaluating a patient suspected of having LC is to obtain a gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and spinal cord, which has a sensitivity of 76%-87%. Typical findings include linear or nodular leptomeningeal enhancement along the surface of the brain and spinal cord, enhancement of the cranial nerves or nerve roots, and/or hydrocephalus. Diagnosis can be made in patients with known metastatic cancer who have typical clinical presentations and MRI findings. A lumbar puncture is obtained in most patients after MRI as it increases diagnostic accuracy. However, it should be avoided in patients with large intracranial and/or spinal masses due to the risk of cerebral herniation. Furthermore, lumbar puncture performed before MRI can result in an artifact that can sometimes be confused with LC (Choice C). Typical findings include elevated opening pressure, low glucose, elevated protein, and mild lymphocytotic pleocytosis. Cytology should also be analyzed and is considered the gold standard for diagnosis (highly specific), but can be negative in up to 20% of cases. (Choice A) Empiric therapy with intravenous acyclovir is indicated for suspected herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis due to the high mortality rate if treatment is delayed. Patients with HSV encephalitis can present with the rapid onset of fever, headache, altered mental status, ataxia, and flaccid paralysis. However, this patient's subacute presentation, lack of fever, and spastic muscle weakness make this diagnosis less likely. (Choice B) This patient's ataxic gait could be from a posterior fossa (cerebellar) lesion or spinal nerve root involvement. An MRI is better for evaluating posterior fossa lesions, cranial nuclei involvement, and leptomeningeal enhancement. In addition, an MRI of the spine is needed in this patient. (Choice E) Vitamin B12 deficiency would not typically cause cranial nerve involvement and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.",

"choice_a": "Magnesium deficiency",
"choice_b": "Marijuana toxicity",
"choice_c": "Refeeding syndrome",
"choice_d": "Starvation ketoacidosis",
"choice_e": "Vitamin deficiency",
"correct_answer": "E",
"explanation": "This underweight woman with multiple electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, and an anion gap metabolic acidosis with urine ketones has evidence of severe malnourishment, likely from anorexia nervosa. She developed double vision with lateral gaze palsy and lethargy after an infusion of dextrose-containing solution, raising concern for Wernicke encephalopathy (WE). WE is a neurologic complication of thiamine deficiency; it classically manifests as the triad of ataxia, encephalopathy (eg, lethargy), and oculomotor dysfunction (eg, nystagmus, gaze palsies), although all 3 signs often do not present together. It is usually associated with long-standing alcohol abuse; however, WE may be caused by any disorder causing chronic malnourishment (eg, anorexia nervosa, hyperemesis gravidarum, post-bariatric surgery). Iatrogenic WE can be precipitated in malnourished patients by the administration of dextrose, which depletes the last remaining stores of thiamine (a cofactor for enzymes involved in glucose metabolism). Most physicians are aware of the need to give thiamine with dextrose in patients with chronic alcohol use; however, there is less awareness regarding thiamine administration with dextrose for other at-risk populations. (Choice A) Magnesium deficiency may cause hypokalemia and vertical nystagmus, but severe deficiency also typically causes hypocalcemia, involuntary movements, seizures, and arrhythmias. It is unlikely to cause a gaze palsy. (Choice B) Marijuana toxicity usually presents with acute mood and thought disturbances in addition to red eyes, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and dry mouth. However, it does not usually cause vision disturbances or nystagmus. (Choice C) Refeeding syndrome occurs in a chronically malnourished patient and may cause hypokalemia; however, it also leads to severe hypophosphatemia and causes congestive heart failure, edema, seizures, and rhabdomyolysis. Although this patient is at risk for development of refeeding syndrome, gaze palsies would be unlikely. (Choice D) Starvation (or fasting) ketoacidosis is a normal response to fasting and is commonly seen in patients who are malnourished or even on low-carbohydrate diets. Although this patient does have starvation ketoacidosis, fasting ketosis itself would not cause visual changes.",

"choice_e": "Serum serotonin levels",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "This patient exhibits signs and symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome, a potentially dangerous condition associated with excess serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. Serotonin syndrome is usually caused by inadvertent interactions between drugs, therapeutic use of multiple serotonergic agents, or overdose on serotonergic medications. This patient is taking multiple medications with serotonergic activity, including St. John's wort, venlafaxine (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), and tramadol. No tests confirm the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome, which is made based on medication history and clinical findings. Symptoms include a classic triad of mental status changes (eg, anxiety, delirium, confusion, restlessness), autonomic dysregulation (eg, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, diarrhea, mydriasis), and neuromuscular hyperactivity (eg, hyperreflexia, tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, ocular clonus, bilateral Babinski signs). First-line treatment includes removal of precipitating drugs, supportive care (eg, hydration), and benzodiazepines. Failure of symptoms to resolve or onset of more severe symptoms (eg, hyperthermia, disorientation) may require the use of cyproheptadine, a serotonin antagonist. (Choices A and D) If the diagnosis is unclear and symptoms are severe, CT scan can be helpful to evaluate for intracranial bleeding or mass, and lumbar puncture can help rule out meningitis. However, this patient's presentation is highly suggestive of serotonin syndrome, and further diagnostic procedures are not necessary at this time. (Choice B) Electroencephalogram (EEG) is typically used to determine whether seizure activity is occurring. During seizure activity, the EEG typically displays a characteristic synchronous spike-and-wave pattern followed by postictal suppression. Seizure activity involves episodes of tonic-clonic movements followed by a postictal state, but this patient has no tonic movements associated with her clonus and does not appear postictal, lowering clinical suspicion for seizures. (Choice E) No laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome, as serum serotonin levels do not correlate with clinical findings in this condition. Checking serotonin levels would be indicated in a condition such as carcinoid syndrome.",

"stem": "A 72-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to right-sided numbness and weakness. The patient says his right side felt numb when he awoke at 5:00 AM, and he was unable to get out of bed due to right arm and leg weakness. The patient called an ambulance and arrived at the emergency department within 45 minutes. He was feeling well with no symptoms when he went to bed last night at 10:00 PM and does not know when his symptoms began. The patient has never had similar symptoms and has no headache, head trauma, fever, or chills. Medical conditions include hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but the patient is nonadherent with medical care and has not seen his primary care physician for the past several years. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years. Temperature is 36.5 C (97.7 F), blood pressure is 202/104 mm Hg, and pulse is 84/min and regular. The patient is alert but has frequent word-finding difficulty. Right facial droop is present. Motor strength and sensation to pinprick are decreased in the right upper and lower extremities. Babinski reflex is present on the right. Bedside swallow assessment shows no signs of aspiration. Noncontrast CT scan of the head reveals no evidence of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. Blood cell counts, serum chemistry studies, and coagulation tests are within normal limits. Blood glucose is 120 mg/dL. An ECG shows sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes, and chest radiograph is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",

"choice_e": "Thrombolytic therapy only",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "This patient with new focal weakness and head CT scan without evidence of intracranial or subarachnoid hemorrhage has experienced an acute ischemic cerebrovascular accident (CVA). First-line therapy for eligible patients is intravenous thrombolytic therapy (eg, alteplase); however, treatment must be initiated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. If timing of CVA is unknown, time of onset is when the patient was at last known normal neurologic function (eg, 10:00 PM for this patient). Those outside the 4.5-hour window, such as this patient, are not candidates for thrombolytic therapy (Choices D and E). Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated in those with a large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation and persistent neurologic defects. It can be performed regardless of alteplase administration and should not be delayed to evaluate response to thrombolysis. Thrombectomy must be initiated within the first 24 hours of last known normal status. Therefore, this patient should undergo further evaluation with a CT or MR angiography. Aspirin reduces the risk of recurrent ischemic strokes and should be given within 24-48 hours; however, it should be withheld for 24 hours in patients who undergo thrombolysis. Blood pressure (BP) management is guided by the administration of thrombolytic therapy. In patients who are not candidates for thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy, permissive hypertension is allowed to maintain perfusion to the ischemic brain. These patients are treated only for extremely elevated BP (systolic BP >220 mm Hg or diastolic BP >120 mm Hg) or if active coronary artery disease, heart failure, aortic dissection, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute renal failure, or preeclampsia/eclampsia are present. Extremely elevated BP is lowered by no more than 15% in the first 24 hours, typically with intravenous antihypertensive agents. Patients who undergo thrombolysis should have BP lowered to <185/110 mm Hg before therapy and maintained at <180/105 mm Hg for at least 24 hours after administration. (Choices A and B) This patient is not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy and he has no indications for acute blood pressure lowering. In addition, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel has been shown to increase bleeding risk without improving outcomes in a primary stroke and is not recommended.",

Her caretakers state that the patient became mildly confused and had a headache yesterday. Earlier today, the patient had involuntary shaking of her right upper and lower extremities followed by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The patient's family reports that she has not had any sick contacts or recent travel. She has no cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms. Her other medical problems include hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient has no known allergies. Her temperature is 38.1 C (100.8 F), blood pressure is 140/88 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min and regular, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

"choice_d": "Perform MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium",
"choice_e": "Switch from ceftriaxone to cefepime",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This elderly patient with fever, mental status changes, and focal seizures, has possible herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, the most common cause of fatal encephalitis. HSV encephalitis is seen more frequently in the immunocompromised and the elderly (age >70). It is likely due to viral reactivation of previous latent HSV-1 infection. Patients typically have headache, fever, and possible seizures. Diagnosis is confirmed by HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); this test is 98% sensitive and 94%-100% specific. However, patients with suspected viral encephalitis should be empirically treated with intravenous (IV) acyclovir while awaiting the results of investigations. Acyclovir halts viral replication and can prevent central nervous system damage; treatment delay can lead to significant neurologic complications. CSF HSV PCR test results are not significantly altered, even if acyclovir is given for 7 days. In addition to receiving acyclovir, this patient should continue to be empirically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics against organisms that can also cause encephalitis/meningitis. (Choice B) In patients with suspected or confirmed pneumococcal meningitis treated with dexamethasone (which may impact vancomycin penetration into CSF), rifampin can be added to vancomycin and ceftriaxone if the organism shows intermediate susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. However, this patient is not on dexamethasone therapy. (Choice C) Bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is usually indicated to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus, which can sometimes be caused by HSV encephalitis. This patient may need EEG monitoring, but IV acyclovir should be empirically started first in order to avoid treatment delay. (Choice D) Brain MRI with/without gadolinium helps to identify acute ischemic stroke in patients with mental status changes. New focal seizures occur in <5% of acute strokes. However, this patient's negative non-contrast head CT obtained a day after the onset of symptoms makes stroke less likely. Brain MRI can also identify areas of enhancement, which can suggest an infectious etiology. Acyclovir should be started before obtaining a brain MRI to avoid treatment delay. (Choice E) Patients with impaired cellular immunity (eg, due to lymphoma or cytotoxic chemotherapy) who also have meningitis should be treated with vancomycin, ampicillin, and either cefepime or meropenem to ensure antibiotic coverage against Listeria monocytogenes and gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, patients who have healthcare-acquired meningitis (eg, in the presence of ventricular drain, head trauma, or recent neurosurgery) should receive cefepime or ceftazidime or meropenem in addition to vancomycin.",

"choice_c": "Intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor",
"choice_d": "Oral prednisone",
"choice_e": "Topical pilocarpine",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with optic neuritis, an inflammatory demyelinating condition of the optic nerve leading to acute visual loss. Optic neuritis is likely immune mediated and typically presents with acute monocular vision loss over a period of hours to days, eye pain, central scotoma, and loss of color vision out of proportion to loss of visual acuity. Examination can show afferent pupillary defect, hyperemia/swelling of the optic disk, and blurring of disk margins with distended veins. Optic neuritis is frequently associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Approximately 15%-20% of MS patients initially present with optic neuritis, and nearly 50% develop it during the course of their illness. MRI of the brain and orbits with gadolinium can show optic nerve inflammation and characteristic findings of MS, including ovoid-shaped periventricular white matter lesions that are >3 mm. In general, oral and intravenous corticosteroids are considered equally efficacious for the treatment of acute MS attacks. However, intravenous methylprednisolone is preferred in patients with acute optic neuritis as oral therapy is associated with increased risk of recurrent optic neuritis (Choice D). (Choice A) Aspirin is given for atherosclerotic vascular disease, which is unlikely in this young patient. (Choice C) Intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor is used for the treatment of retinal vein occlusions and macular degeneration. MRI would not show periventricular white matter lesions in these patients. (Choice E) Topical pilocarpine can lower intraocular pressure in acute angle-closure glaucoma. Patients typically develop the acute onset of decreased vision, halos around lights, headache, severe eye pain, and nausea/vomiting. Examination can show conjunctival erythema, corneal edema, and a mid-dilated pupil reacting poorly to light. MRI usually does not show abnormal findings, as seen in this patient.",

The headaches started 1 month ago and have progressively gotten worse. They occur in the right orbitofrontal region, are sharp in quality, fluctuate in intensity, and have recently been waking her from sleep. She noticed 2 weeks ago that her left arm was weaker than usual. She has taken ibuprofen, with only slight improvement of the headaches. Her temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min. Neurologic examination shows a slight left lower facial palsy and a pronator drift in the left upper extremity. Reflexes are 3+ on the left side of the body, with an ipsilateral Babinski sign. The rest of the neurologic examination shows no abnormalities. Basic blood work is normal. An MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium shows a single ring-enhancing lesion with mild surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect at the grey-white junction in the right frontal lobe that is diffusion-restriction negative.

"choice_c": "Levetiracetam 500 mg every 12 hours",
"choice_d": "Lumbar puncture",
"choice_e": "Whole-brain radiation therapy",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "In the setting of metastatic breast cancer, a new-onset headache with focal neurologic deficits should prompt a workup for cerebral metastatic disease. On brain MRI with and without gadolinium, metastasis appears as a ring-enhancing lesion with significant reactive vasogenic edema with or without local mass effect. Radiographically, metastasis can mimic an infectious process (e.g., abscess). However, metastasis does not cause restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted MR sequences, whereas an abscess causes homogeneous restricted diffusion. Also, a cerebral abscess causes fever and peripheral leukocytosis. This patient most likely has a solitary cerebral metastasis and needs to be urgently started on intravenous steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone or dexamethasone) to reduce the surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect. Reducing the edema might improve the patient's neurologic deficits. (Choice A) Craniotomy with excisional biopsy of the right frontal lesion is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. However, the next step in the management of this patient is to reduce the vasogenic edema and mass effect by starting intravenous steroids. (Choice C) Current studies show prophylactic anticonvulsant medications are mainly beneficial in patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors who present with a seizure. Prophylactic anticonvulsants (for 1 week with taper afterwards) are also indicated in patients who have had a craniotomy for brain tumor resection, brain MRI showing acute hemorrhage within the tumor, or significant mass effect/edema in the vicinity of the cortex. Steroids can acutely reduce the edema and greatly reduce the risk of seizure in this patient. (Choice D) A lumbar puncture is contraindicated in the setting of a space-occupying lesion with mass effect and/or midline shift, due to risk of herniation. In addition, this patient's clinical history, brain imaging, and blood work are not suggestive of an infectious process. (Choice E) Whole-brain radiation therapy is indicated in patients with multifocal brain metastases. For solitary metastasis, the treatment of choice is surgical resection.",

"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "This patient with back pain, paresthesias, symmetric weakness worse in the lower extremities, and hyporeflexia likely has Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), or acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Classic GBS presents as a progressive, symmetric ascending weakness or paralysis, often a few days to a week after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (especially Campylobacter jejuni). About one-third of patients have no history of antecedent illness. As the weakness ascends (eg, difficulty walking with 3/5 strength in the lower extremities compared with 4/5 strength in the upper extremities in this patient), bulbar symptoms (eg, ophthalmoplegia, facial diplegia, dysarthria, dysphasia) and respiratory compromise can develop. Back pain can be a presenting feature of GBS as the disease targets primarily the proximal nerves and nerve roots in either the cervical or lumbar spine. Although GBS is primarily a motor polyneuropathy, patients can have mild sensory symptoms such as paresthesias and sensory ataxia. GBS patients also are at risk of developing dysautonomia (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis, sluggish pupils). Examination shows absent reflexes. Lumbar puncture is indicated in all suspected GBS patients to rule out infectious etiologies and document elevated cerebrospinal protein with a normal cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count (albuminocytologic dissociation). However, lumbar puncture may not be diagnostic in some GBS patients as it may take up to a week after symptom onset to see the abnormal findings. Nerve conduction study and electromyography are also indicated to confirm the diagnosis and estimate prognosis. Treatment is mainly supportive, with plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin. Current evidence does not recommend corticosteroids as they are not beneficial. Most patients recover within several weeks to months. (Choice A) Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are useful for diagnosing myasthenia gravis, which usually presents with fluctuating muscle weakness and muscular fatigue. However, myasthenia gravis usually does not present as a rapidly ascending weakness. (Choices C and D) The topographical pattern of deficits in this patient (bilateral symptoms) would not be consistent with a focal structural lesion in the brain (eg, stroke or tumor). MRI of the cervical spine would be low yield in this patient as it would not explain the abnormal cranial nerve findings. This patient also does not have upper motor neuron signs (eg, brisk reflexes) to suggest myelopathy. (Choice E) Serum rapid plasma reagin test is used to diagnosis syphilis. Tabes dorsalis (a manifestation of neurosyphilis) can cause sensory ataxia, paresthesias, back pain, and abnormal pupillary response (Argyll-Robertson pupil). However, it does not cause ascending weakness, and Argyll-Robertson pupils accommodate but do not react to light.",

"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation suggests generalized myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is due to autoantibodies blocking acetylcholine receptors. Ocular MG presents with eyelid and ocular muscle weakness. Generalized MG affects ocular muscles with variable involvement of bulbar (eg, dysarthria, dysphagia, fatigable chewing), limb, or respiratory muscles. These symptoms can fluctuate throughout the day but are usually worse later in the day. Weakness and fatigue worsen with exercise, stress, or infection and improve with rest. Diagnosis of MG is confirmed with serology. Acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody is present in up to 85% of MG patients. Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase receptor (MuSK) antibodies are present in up to 50% of AchR-antibody-negative patients. MG is also commonly associated with thymic hyperplasia, thymoma, and autoimmune thyroid disease. All MG patients should have thyroid-stimulating hormone measured to evaluate for thyroiditis and chest computed tomography to look for mediastinal mass (thymoma). Once the diagnosis of MG is confirmed via serology or electrophysiology, patients can be treated with symptomatic (eg, pyridostigmine) and/or immune (eg, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin) therapies. (Choice A) Lumbar puncture can help diagnose multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or central nervous system tumor. Multiple sclerosis usually presents with relapsing-remitting episodes of neurologic dysfunction disseminated in space and time. Guillain-Barre syndrome typically presents with ascending weakness, absent deep-tendon reflexes, and mild sensory symptoms after a recent viral illness. Central nervous system tumors (lymphomatous or carcinomatous meningitis) have other symptoms, including headache, nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, focal weakness, radicular pain, or cranial nerve palsies. (Choice B) Brain magnetic resonance imaging is recommended in MG patients who have bulbar symptoms to rule out other pathology. However, cervical spine imaging does not explain this patient's ocular findings. (Choice C) Muscle biopsy can diagnose a myopathy, which can cause symmetrical muscle weakness but not ocular symptoms. (Choice E) Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a paraneoplastic syndrome most commonly associated with small-cell lung cancer. LEMS presentation can be similar to myasthenia gravis. Both can have ocular symptoms and muscle weakness. In LEMS, deep-tendon reflexes are decreased or absent. However, deep-tendon reflexes and weakness improve with repetitive muscle activation. Voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies confirm the diagnosis. Given this patient's young age and mediastinal (rather than lung) mass, MG is more likely.",

"explanation": "This patient has evidence of acute left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke associated with ipsilateral, high-grade carotid stenosis. In addition to medical therapy including aspirin, statin, blood pressure control, and risk modification (eg, glucose control, smoking cessation), he also requires consultation to consider carotid revascularization. Symptomatic patients (ie, transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke within the distribution of the affected vessel) with a life expectancy of >=5 years and high-grade stenosis (70%-99%) should be offered a carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Post-hoc analysis of pooled data from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) suggests that CEA within 1-2 weeks of a nondisabling stroke or transient ischemic attack improves outcomes compared with later surgery; very early CEA (<48 hours) is associated with higher risk of recurrent stroke. (Choice A) In very large strokes with associated cerebral edema or hemorrhagic complications, a delay of 4-6 weeks for revascularization is reasonable. However, in most cases, revascularization should be completed within 1-2 weeks. In high-grade stenosis, CEA is preferred to carotid artery stenting due to lower periprocedural mortality and stroke rates. (Choice C) Studies have found no benefit of early anticoagulation in the setting of acute ischemic stroke (whether due to atherosclerotic disease or cardioembolism) due to the significant risk of hemorrhagic transformation. (Choice D) Warfarin is not more beneficial than antiplatelet therapy in atherothrombotic or atherothromboembolic strokes and carries a significant risk of bleeding.

"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation of acute, sustained vertigo with bidirectional nystagmus is concerning for cerebellar stroke. Cerebellar stroke can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of vertigo, particularly vestibular neuritis. Up to 25% of patients age >50 who come to the emergency department with acute-onset isolated vertigo have cerebellar infarction rather than vestibular neuritis. Characteristics of nystagmus can help distinguish central from peripheral causes of vertigo: Peripheral disease (eg, vestibular neuritis, Meniere disease) causes a suppressible nystagmus that does not reverse direction; it beats away from the lesion. Central disease (eg, cerebellar stroke, multiple sclerosis) causes a nonsuppressible nystagmus that can reverse direction (eg, bidirectional); it often beats toward the lesion. Features suggestive of cerebellar stroke include limb ataxia, inability to ambulate, falling/nystagmus to the side of the lesion, and symptoms persisting for >=72 hours. In addition to neurologic abnormalities (eg, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia), the presence of persistent hiccups is supportive. Cerebellar stroke is more common in elderly patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Neuroimaging should be obtained in patients with vertigo if there are risk factors for stroke, new headache or neurologic deficits, or features consistent with a central lesion. MRI and MR angiography are the preferred studies given their high sensitivity/specificity in detecting acute cerebellar infarction and posterior circulation occlusion, respectively. CT scan is less sensitive in detecting posterior fossa abnormalities and may be normal within the initial hours of stroke onset. (Choice A) Audiometry has limited utility in the evaluation of vertigo but may be used to assess hearing loss in patients with suspected Meniere disease or vestibular schwannoma. (Choice B) Carotid ultrasound is of limited use in this patient with cerebellar/posterior circulation signs (eg, vertigo, nystagmus, ataxia). (Choice C) The Epley maneuver is a particle-repositioning maneuver that can be used to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Although BPPV may present with nystagmus and vertigo provoked by head movement, nystagmus is typically unidirectional rather than bidirectional, symptoms are typically brief (usually seconds), and ataxia is usually absent. (Choice E) Reassurance and short-term use of antihistamines such as meclizine may be considered for symptomatic treatment of peripheral vertigo (eg, vestibular neuritis).

Earlier in the morning she had blurry vision and saw halos around lights. She took ibuprofen an hour ago but vomited shortly afterward. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The patient feels uncomfortable when her eyes are examined with a flashlight. The pupils are equal and reactive. Muscle strength and tone are normal and deep-tendon reflexes are symmetrical. She is treated with intravenous metoclopramide. One hour later, she complains of neck pain. Physical examination shows sustained contraction of the posterior neck muscles associated with neck extension and tenderness. What is the best next step in management of this patient?",

"choice_c": "Lumbar puncture",
"choice_d": "Noncontrast CT of the head",
"choice_e": "Subcutaneous sumatriptan",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "This patient has likely developed metoclopramide-induced acute dystonia. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist that also blocks serotonin receptors at higher doses. The drug is often used in the emergency department as monotherapy for acute migraine associated with nausea/vomiting. It may also be effective for diabetic gastroparesis. Potential side effects include akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia. Acute dystonia presents with sustained muscular contractions resulting in twisting or abnormal postures (eg, torticollis, retrocollis, oculogyric crisis). Retrocollis is characterized by sustained contraction of the posterior neck muscles resulting in neck extension and pain, as seen in this patient. Patients with suspected drug-induced dystonia should stop the offending agent. Treatment also involves anticholinergics (eg, benztropine, trihexyphenidyl) or agents with both anticholinergic and antihistamine effects (eg, diphenhydramine). These treatments should be started at low doses with slow titration to achieve improvement. They should also be tapered off gradually due to the risk of withdrawal side effects. (Choice A) Haloperidol can control acute agitation, but it is also a dopamine receptor blocker that can further exacerbate extrapyramidal symptoms. (Choice C) Lumbar puncture can diagnose meningitis, but this patient's lack of fever makes the diagnosis unlikely. (Choice D) Noncontrast head CT scan can diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which usually presents as a sudden, severe (\"thunderclap\") headache. This patient's headache was preceded by visual symptoms, which is more typical of migraine with aura. Although meningismus is present in 35% of patients with SAH, this patient's sustained posterior neck extension is more consistent with retrocollis. (Choice E) Subcutaneous sumatriptan may be effective for abortive migraine treatment, but it would not address this patient's acute dystonia.",

The patient is accompanied by his wife, who provides most of the history. The patient was working in his garden 2 days ago when he developed a headache. He thought nothing of it since he was working outdoors on a hot and humid summer day. Over the next 24-hours, the patient became lethargic and developed right-sided weakness. He has not traveled recently and denies insect bites, sick contacts, or flu-like symptoms. His other medical problems include a history of ischemic stroke without residual neurologic deficits, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-paralytic polio as a child. His medications include aspirin, simvastatin, and lisinopril. His temperature is 38.1 C (100.5 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 16/min Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His general physical examination is unremarkable. On neurological examination, he is obtunded and does not follow commands. There are no obvious cranial nerve deficits. He is able to localize briskly to noxious stimuli with the left arm, but he does not move the right arm. He is able to withdraw briskly to noxious stimuli in the lower extremities (left > right). The sensory examination is unreliable. Reflexes are 2+ on the left side of the body, but absent on the right side. Plantar responses are downgoing bilaterally. Superficial abdominal reflexes are present. Rectal tone is normal. Non-contrast CT scan of the head showed no bleeding or masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
"choice_a": "Acute ischemic stroke",
"choice_b": "Enteroviral meningitis",
"choice_c": "Guillain-Barre syndrome",
"choice_d": "Post-polio syndrome",
"choice_e": "West Nile encephalomyelitis",
"correct_answer": "E",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation is suggestive of encephalomyelitis, most likely due to the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. The incidence is highest during the mosquito season in the summer months, especially when the weather is humid. Most patients are asymptomatic or only develop fever. Encephalitis associated with acute asymmetric flaccid paralysis or extrapyramidal symptoms is highly suggestive of West Nile virus infection. The West Nile virus typically causes anterior horn cell injury (poliomyelitis) rather than a transverse leukomyelitis. Therefore, patients will have sparing of the ascending (i.e., pain, temperature, vibration, and proprioception) and descending (i.e., pyramidal and extra-pyramidal motor system and autonomics) white matter fibers. Diagnosis is usually confirmed with positive IgM serology for the virus in patients with only fever. Patients with CNS symptoms should undergo lumbar puncture to rule out other etiologies and confirm diagnosis with West Nile IgM antibody titer. Treatment involves mainly supportive care, but preventative mosquito control programs are sometimes effective. (Choice A) This patient has downgoing plantar reflexes, low-grade fever, and worsening mental status changes. This combination makes an ischemic stroke highly unlikely. (Choice B) Enteroviruses commonly cause viral meningitis in the summer and early fall and present with severe headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, and low-grade fever. However, enteroviral meningitis does not usually cause mental status changes, or flaccid paralysis as seen in this patient. (Choice C) Guillain-Barre syndrome usually presents with progressive and symmetrical ascending paralysis, paresthesias, decreased to absent reflexes, and possible respiratory distress. This patient's asymmetrical lower extremity symptoms/signs make this less likely. (Choice D) Post-polio syndrome can be seen in patients with a history of paralytic polio who develop worsening of their previous weakness later in life (> age 50) due to age related drop out of existing large motor units. Patients typically present with progressive weakness, fatigue, and muscle or joint pain. The syndrome usually does not present with fever, mental status changes, headache, or seizures.",

"choice_d": "Prescribe meclizine and schedule outpatient follow-up",
"choice_e": "Recommend vestibular exercises",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with vertigo, likely due to a central cause. Vertigo is classified as either central or peripheral. Peripheral vertigo usually presents with contralateral nystagmus from the affected side that worsens with gaze opposite the lesion and improves with gaze towards the lesion. There is usually a latency period before symptom onset that occurs for only a brief period. Central vertigo presents with less vertigo and more gait disturbances, disequilibrium, vertical and/or torsional nystagmus, and possible various associated neurological symptoms. There is usually no latency period before the onset of nystagmus. This patient's difficulty with walking favors a more central etiology of the vertigo and should be evaluated with MRI with diffusion protocol for possible acute stroke. (Choice B) A blood glucose of 75 mg/dL is generally not low enough to explain the patient's focal neurological deficits. A serum blood glucose <50 mg/dL usually causes focal neurological deficits. (Choice C) Vestibular neuronitis (second most common cause of peripheral vertigo) is usually due to herpes virus and presents with sudden vertigo lasting several days. Methylprednisolone hastens recovery, but acyclovir has limited efficacy in improving symptoms. This patient's symptoms are more consistent with central vertigo. (Choice D) Meclizine is appropriate for patients with suspected BPPV, but this patient's nystagmus and dysmetria are more concerning for central vertigo and should be evaluated with urgent brain MRI. (Choice E) Epley's maneuver (vestibular exercises) is a bedside procedure for BPPV and involves moving the patient's head in various directions to reposition the dislodged otolith in the semicircular canals. However, these maneuvers are less effective for central vertigo.",

"choice_d": "Orthostatic vital signs",
"choice_e": "Tilt-table testing",
"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "This patient is presenting with convulsive syncope. Brief myoclonic activity associated with syncope is due to cerebral hypoperfusion and can commonly be mistaken for seizure. Features that are more suggestive of seizure include a post-ictal state, tongue biting, head/eye turning to one side, and hypersalivation. The evaluation of syncope should begin with a careful history, physical examination (including orthostatic vital signs), and an electrocardiogram (ECG), as this will identify a specific cause in about 60% of cases. This patient's presentation of syncope in the setting of prolonged standing (eg, washing the dishes) and use of multiple antihypertensive medications (eg, a calcium channel blocker and a diuretic) raises suspicion for orthostatic hypotension; another possibility is vasovagal syncope. The most appropriate next step in management is to check orthostatic vital signs. Additional testing should be based on the initial clinical evaluation. (Choices A and B) Brain imaging, electroencephalogram, and carotid Doppler are rarely useful unless there is concern for a non-syncopal cause of transient loss of consciousness (eg, seizure, cerebrovascular disease). This patient's lack of post-ictal confusion or tongue biting and normal neurologic examination make a non-syncopal cause of transient loss of consciousness less likely. (Choice C) An echocardiogram should be performed in patients suspected of having structural heart disease. However, it would be of limited value in this patient as her syncope did not occur in the setting of physical exertion and her ECG and cardiovascular examination were normal. (Choice E) Tilt-table testing can be useful for diagnosing vasovagal syncope (sensitivity 26%-80%, specificity 90%), but it is usually reserved for patients with atypical presentations, recurrent syncopal episodes after cardiovascular etiologies have been excluded, or after a single unexplained syncopal episode when the diagnosis must be excluded (eg, high risk of physical harm or occupational hazard).",

"choice_e": "Prescribe verapamil",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "This patient with a history of migraine who presents with an occipital headache, brainstem symptoms, and a normal brain MRI is likely experiencing a migraine with brainstem aura (MBA; previously known as a basilar-type migraine). MBA is a rare subset of migraine characterized by aura with brainstem symptoms (eg, vertigo, dysarthria, ataxia) without motor weakness. It is most common in women with a history of migraine. Diagnosis requires the presence of >2 basilar aura symptoms (shown in the table) that are fully reversible. Occipital headaches may suggest the diagnosis but are not always present. The symptoms of MBA can mimic dysfunction of the posterior cerebral circulation; differential diagnosis includes transient ischemic attack and basilar aneurysm, as well as temporal lobe epilepsy and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. As a result, most patients require MRI of the brain and MR angiography of the head and neck to rule out posterior vascular lesions. After vascular lesions have been ruled out, patients can be treated with antiemetics and non-vasoconstricting agents (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Triptans (eg, sumatriptan), beta blockers, and ergotamine derivatives are contraindicated in MBA because they may lead to vasoconstriction and ischemia of the vertebral-basilar system (Choice A). Verapamil is preferred for chronic prevention (Choice E); alternatives include lamotrigine, amitriptyline, and topiramate. (Choice B) Oral contraceptives should be discontinued in patients who experience migraine with aura. However, this patient first warrants additional imaging due to the potentially devastating complications of missed neurovascular disease.

"choice_b": "Decompressive surgery",
"choice_c": "Intrathecal chemotherapy",
"choice_d": "Intravenous chemotherapy",

"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "This patient has neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression likely due to metastatic prostate cancer. His presentation of back pain followed by progressive spastic lower extremity paraparesis and an epidural mass with spinal cord edema is characteristic. Intravenous glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone) are usually given to patients with neoplastic cord compression and severe neurologic deficits, although evidence of improved neurologic outcomes is limited. Definitive therapy with spinal surgery and/or radiation therapy increases the likelihood that the patient will regain normal ambulation; choice of therapy depends on the patient's characteristics. Those with an unstable spine, limited disease burden, and favorable prognosis can benefit from spinal surgery (eg, tumor resection, spine stabilization) followed by radiation therapy as these patients have a higher likelihood of regaining neurologic function. Radiation therapy alone can be considered in patients with a stable spine and radiosensitive neoplasm (eg, breast cancer, lymphoma, multiple myeloma) or as palliative therapy in those with a poor prognosis and limited life expectancy. (Choices A, D, and E) Androgen deprivation therapy with leuprolide can be used to treat metastatic prostate cancer, and intravenous chemotherapy (eg, taxanes) can be considered in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Parenteral bisphosphonates such as pamidronate can be useful in treating bone pain and delaying pathologic fractures in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases. Pamidronate should be used very cautiously in those with renal insufficiency. This patient's spinal cord compression is a neurologic emergency, and he should first be evaluated for definitive spinal surgery to help prevent permanent disability before considering any of these therapies. (Choice C) Intrathecal chemotherapy is used to treat leptomeningeal (dura, arachnoid, and pia mater) metastases due to certain solid and hematologic malignancies (eg, breast, lymphoma, leukemia among others). This patient has extrinsic cord compression from an epidural mass, not leptomeningeal metastases. In addition, leptomeningeal spread of prostate cancer is extremely rare, and it is not treated with intrathecal chemotherapy.",

"choice_e": "Respiratory rate",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with myasthenic crisis, defined as severe weakness from myasthenia gravis requiring intubation. Myasthenic crisis is usually due to weakness of the respiratory muscles but can also present as severe oropharyngeal weakness resulting in dysphagia and aspiration. The common precipitants are infection and surgery (Table); however, it can also present as a progression of myasthenia gravis. Patients should be monitored in the intensive care unit with respiratory status checks every 2-4 hours using vital capacity (VC) and maximal inspiratory force (MIF). Both VC and MIF should be interpreted in combination as neither is superior to the other. Patients require intubation for VC <20 mL/kg or MIF >-30 cm H2O (eg, 0 to -30). Anticholinesterase inhibitors should be stopped temporarily while the patient is on mechanical ventilation to minimize secretions. Rapid treatment involves plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in addition to high-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone 60-80 mg/day) due to the short-lived therapeutic effect of plasmapheresis and IVIG. Patients who cannot tolerate glucocorticoids can be started on azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclosporine. Weaning and extubation are considered in patients with improved muscle strength (eg, ability to lift head off bed, VC >20 mL/kg. MIF <-30 cm H2O).

"explanation": "This patient with a history of diabetes mellitus presents with complaints of abrupt onset of asymmetric, multiple peripheral neuropathies suggestive of mononeuritis multiplex. Mononeuritis multiplex is a painful, asymmetrical, sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy. It affects 2 or more nerves in different parts of the body and is most common in patients with vasculitides, connective tissue diseases, or systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus. Multiple long nerves (eg, sciatic, peroneal, tibial, radial) in random areas of the body are commonly affected first. As the disease progresses, neuropathy can become more confluent and symmetrical. Patients typically present with complaints of pain, numbness, dysesthesias, or loss of reflexes. Some patients may initially present with foot drop (steppage or foot-slapping gait) or wrist drop. Clinical symptoms are sufficient to make the diagnosis. However, nerve biopsy (which shows epineurial perivascular inflammation) or electrodiagnostic studies can be performed if there is insufficient evidence. Treatment includes controlling the primary disease process. In patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate control of primary disease, over-the-counter analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsant drugs (eg, gabapentin) can be used. Most patients recover without long-term consequences, but some may have muscle wasting and irreversible damage due to nerve infarction.

Sensory symptoms are absent. (Choice B) L5 radiculopathy is the most common lumbosacral radiculopathy. Patients present with back pain that radiates down the lateral surface of the leg into the foot. Hand symptoms are not seen in L5 radiculopathy. (Choice C) Patients with lacunar strokes may present with sensory or motor symptoms, hemiparesis, or dysarthria. This patient has predominantly lower motor neuron signs (ie, absent reflexes). (Choice E) Multiple sclerosis usually occurs in patients age 15-50 years. Patients commonly present with 2 or more distinct episodes of central nervous system dysfunction with partial or complete resolution.

Cluster headache is more common in men, and the diagnosis is suggested when the patient has 5 or more severe headache attacks with 1 or more ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (eg, ptosis, miosis, lacrimation, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion). Patients are usually agitated or restless, which can help differentiate cluster headache from migraine. Brain MRI, even in the setting of a typical presentation, is usually obtained during the initial evaluation to exclude intracranial abnormalities. Current guidelines recommend 100% oxygen (12 L/min for 15 min) and/or subcutaneous sumatriptan as a first-line treatment for acute cluster headache. Preventive therapy should also be promptly initiated. Verapamil is the preferred preventive treatment, sometimes accompanied by a short course of oral corticosteroids. (Choices A and E) Acute angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) may present with severe headache, eye pain, and conjunctival injection; however, this patient's young age and absence of other features (eg, decreased vision, nausea/vomiting, poorly reactive mid-dilated pupil) make the diagnosis unlikely.

The patient has a 40-pack-year smoking history. His mother had polycystic kidney disease and his father died of a heart attack. Blood pressure is 175/105 mm Hg and pulse is 65/min and regular. On neurologic examination, the patient is awake and alert. He has a left-homonymous hemianopsia, right forced gaze deviation, reduced sensation on the left side of the face, and left lower facial paresis. He also has left-sided hemiplegia with an extensor plantar response. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
"choice_a": "Atherothrombosis of large artery",
"choice_b": "Embolism from a cardiac source",
"choice_c": "Lipohyalinosis of small vessel",
"choice_d": "Rupture of berry aneurysm",
"choice_e": "Rupture of bridging vein",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient's focal neurologic deficits are consistent with a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. MCA strokes typically present with contralateral somatosensory and motor weakness (eg, face, arm, leg). Patients can also have conjugate eye deviation toward the side of infarct, contralateral homonymous hemianopsia (superior and inferior optic radiations), hemineglect (if affecting nondominant hemisphere), or aphasia (if affecting the dominant hemisphere). Causes of ischemic stroke can often be differentiated by the patient's clinical characteristics and progression of symptoms. Thrombotic strokes are due to local (in situ) obstruction of large arteries, usually in areas of underlying atherosclerosis. Patients typically have atherosclerotic risk factors (eg, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, previous transient ischemic attack) and develop fluctuating symptoms with periodic improvement and stuttering progression as thrombus is forming in the diseased segment. Embolic strokes are often due to mural thrombus arising remotely in the heart, aorta, or large vessels (eg, atrial fibrillation, paradoxical embolism across patent foramen ovale). Embolic strokes usually involve abrupt onset of focal neurologic findings with maximal symptoms at onset. Patients may have embolic obstruction of multiple vascular territories (Choice B). This patient's fluctuating, progressive neurologic deficits indicate thrombotic ischemic stroke of the MCA. (Choice C) Small-vessel lipohyalinosis typically causes lacunar infarcts due to occlusion of a single penetrating branch of a larger artery. Patients usually develop limited focal motor and/or sensory symptoms, ataxia, or dysarthria. This patient's extensive neurologic deficits, including visual defects and hemiparesis, make lipohyalinosis less likely. (Choice D) Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage is usually due to a ruptured arterial saccular (berry) aneurysm and presents with sudden-onset headache associated with possible meningismus or focal neurologic deficits. This patient's intermittent symptoms without headache or rapid progression of symptoms make hemorrhagic stroke less likely. (Choice E) Acute subdural hematomas (SDHs) form after rupture of a bridging vein, typically due to trauma. They present with a \"lucid interval\" before progression to coma, typically within 24-48 hours after onset. Chronic SDHs may present with slowly progressive cognitive impairment, headaches, and seizures weeks after onset. Educational objective: Ischemic stroke is classified as embolic or thrombotic. Embolic strokes usually have abrupt onset of focal neurologic findings with maximal symptoms at onset. Thrombotic strokes usually present as fluctuating symptoms with periodic improvement and stuttering progression.",

"stem": "A 60-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for acute onset of low back pain radiating down her left leg after lifting heavy boxes at home. She denies any muscle weakness and has no problems with bowel or bladder function. She states that her back pain worsens with coughing or bearing down. Her past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She recently received a flu shot which made her experience mild flu-like symptoms. She has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for many years, but denies alcohol use. Her temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min and regular. Neurological examination reveals 5/5 muscle strength in all four extremities with 2+ reflexes. Straight leg raise sign is positive on the left. Sensory examination reveals reduced pinprick and temperature sensation along the posterolateral region of the left leg. Basic metabolic panel is normal. Plain radiograph of the lumbar spine shows only degenerative changes. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
"choice_a": "Bone density testing",

"choice_e": "Physical therapy",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "This patient's symptoms - back pain radiating down the leg which is worsened with coughing or bearing down - are consistent with an acute lumbosacral radiculopathy (ALSR). ALSR is most often due to a mechanical compression of the L5 and/or S1 dorsal root, usually by a herniated disk. ALSR typically presents with low back and leg pain (sciatica), often with associated numbness and/or weakness in the leg. Reproduction of radicular pain with flexion at the hip and dorsiflexion at the ankle (positive straight leg raise) is relatively specific for the diagnosis. Most patients with ALSR will have spontaneous improvement, and can be managed with conservative measures for comfort. Studies of various medications in ALSR have largely been mixed, though non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often effective and are well tolerated. Anti-spasmodics/muscle relaxants may also be considered, but they are associated with significant sedation and inconsistent benefits. Opioids appear to be less effective and are associated with sedation and a significant risk of dependence. Pain-modifying drugs such as gabapentin are primarily used for chronic symptoms and also cause significant sedation (Choice B). Patients with ALSR should usually be advised to maintain light-normal activity. A brief period of bed rest (<3 days) is also acceptable, but extended bed rest has been shown to provide no benefit and may prolong recovery. If the patient's symptoms fail to improve, or there are new neurological deficits at follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbo-sacral spine and surgical referral may be indicated. (Choice A) Bone density testing should be considered if there is evidence of compression fracture or sacral insufficiency fracture. This patient's x-rays show no evidence of fracture. (Choice D) Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered for patients with low back pain or ALSR who have clinical features to suggest a malignant or infectious etiology (eg, fever, history of malignancy, intravenous drug abuse) or significant neurologic deficit (eg, saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, gross motor weakness). But MRI has been shown to not improve care in patients with uncomplicated back pain or ALSR. (Choice E) Physical therapy and spinal manipulation have shown inconsistent results in treatment of ALSR. They may be considered for patients who do not improve with initial therapy but do not wish to pursue invasive interventions. Educational objective: Acute lumbo-sacral radiculopathy is characterized by low back pain associated with radiating pain and/or numbness along a dermatomal distribution (most commonly L5 and S1). Activity modification and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain are effective in up to 90% of patients. Magnetic resonance imaging is reserved for patients with acute neurological deficits (i.e., weakness, problems walking, or bowel/bladder difficulties), suspicion for infection or malignancy, or failure to improve with initial management.",

There is left-sided hemiplegia with an extensor plantar response. There is also increased cogwheel rigidity in the left upper extremity. A non contrast CT scan of the head is negative for acute hemorrhage. A lesion in which of the following areas is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",
"choice_a": "Brainstem at the level of the medulla oblongata",
"choice_b": "Brainstem at the level of the midbrain",
"choice_c": "Cerebellar hemisphere",
"choice_d": "Cerebral cortex in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery",
"choice_e": "Posterior limb of the internal capsule",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "This patient with multiple vascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking) has an acute, right-sided, non-pupil-sparing, cranial nerve (CN) III palsy, along with left lower facial weakness and left-sided hemiplegia consistent with an acute ischemic stroke, likely in the brainstem. The brainstem is where most cranial nerves originate and where many motor and sensory fibers cross the midline; therefore, brainstem stroke should be considered in patients who have acute CN deficits accompanied by contralateral hemiparesis or hemisensory loss (crossed signs). CN involvement can help with localization based on the origin within the brainstem: Midbrain (CNs III-IV): oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV); Pons (CNs V-VIII): trigeminal (V), abducens (VI), facial (VII), vestibulocochlear (VIII); Medulla oblongata (CNs IX-XII): glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), spinal accessory (XI), hypoglossal (XII). The olfactory (CN I) and optic (CN II) nerves originate in the cerebrum and are not affected in brainstem stroke. This patient with right CN III palsy and crossed signs (eg, left hemiparesis) has an ischemic stroke at the level of the midbrain, sometimes known as Weber syndrome. (Choice A) Strokes at the level of the medullar oblongata cause similar brainstem symptoms (eg, crossed findings, CN involvement); however, CN III involvement is unexpected. Stroke involving the medial medulla can cause tongue weakness (CN XII), whereas lateral medullary strokes can present with ipsilateral Horner syndrome (eg, ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis). Because the respiratory center is located in the medulla, large strokes may cause respiratory compromise. (Choice C) Strokes of the cerebellar hemisphere typically result in ipsilateral ataxia and nystagmus without weakness or numbness. Cranial nerve deficits are not typically seen in cerebellar stroke. (Choice D) An acute cortical stroke in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery would cause contralateral hemiplegia and sensory loss. Aphasia may occur if the dominant hemisphere is involved, but cranial nerve dysfunction is rare. (Choice E) An acute stroke in the posterior limb of the internal capsule would cause a lacunar stroke syndrome. Patients can have contralateral hemiparesis, sensory loss, and occasionally facial weakness. However, strokes in the posterior internal capsule do not usually cause cogwheel rigidity or cranial nerve deficits. Educational objective: Brainstem (ie, midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata) strokes should be considered in patients with acute cranial nerve (CN) deficits and crossed signs (contralateral hemiparesis or hemisensory loss). CN III dysfunction with contralateral hemiplegia suggests a stroke at the level of the midbrain.",

Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is awake, cooperative, and follows commands. Her speech is fluent and her repetition is appropriate. The remainder of her mental status and neurologic examinations shows no abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain reveals an infiltrating 2-cm lesion in the temporal lobe that produces no mass effect and is most consistent with a low-grade glioma. Neurosurgery evaluation is pending. What is the best next step in management of this patient?",
"choice_a": "Electroencephalogram for risk stratification",

"choice_c": "Levetiracetam",
"choice_d": "Lorazepam",
"choice_e": "Reassurance and no medical intervention at this time",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "This patient presents with a single provoked complex partial seizure that secondarily generalized in a structural lesion in the brain. A complex partial seizure is a focal seizure that arises from a cerebral hemisphere and causes alteration/loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, some patients may display semi-purposeful behaviors called automatisms (eg, lip smacking, pacing, grooming behavior, repetitive swallowing). Patients are completely unaware of these behaviors and have no memory of them after the seizure. Complex partial seizures can arise from any region of the cortex but are seen most frequently in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. In general, neurologists do not treat with an antiepileptic drug (AED) unless the patient has had >=2 unprovoked seizures separated by more than 24 hours. In this patient, the seizure was provoked by an underlying structural lesion in the brain. Therefore, treatment with an AED is indicated as the risk of seizure recurrence is high. Given that this patient is of reproductive age, lamotrigine alone or levetiracetam is the best AED to start as it has the fewest teratogenic side effects. Valproic acid is generally contraindicated in young women of reproductive age due to potential teratogenic effects. (Choice A) An electroencephalogram (EEG) for risk stratification is not necessary in this patient as she is already at high risk for seizure recurrence given the presence of a structural lesion on brain imaging. An EEG is helpful for risk stratification in patients with normal brain imaging. (Choice D) Lorazepam is the initial drug of choice for status epilepticus, defined as a prolonged single seizure of > 5-10 minutes or repetitive seizures without return to baseline clinical status between episodes. This patient's presentation is not consistent with status epilepticus. Educational objective: A single focal seizure due to a structural brain lesion has a high risk of recurrence and requires treatment with an antiepileptic drug.",

Family members have been worried about a decline in his general health over the past month as he has been eating less and has been less socially active. The patient has \"felt down\" for several weeks and has had headaches, a decreased appetite, and difficulty eating solid foods due to pain while chewing. Medical history is notable for hypertension, intermittent atrial fibrillation, mild dementia, and a transient ischemic episode 6 months ago. A carotid ultrasonogram performed 6 months ago showed 40% stenosis in the carotid arteries bilaterally. Current medications include triamterene, hydrochlorothiazide, dabigatran, atorvastatin, and aspirin. The patient retired from coal mining 20 years ago and lives alone in an apartment. He does not use tobacco but drinks alcohol on social occasions. Blood pressure is 142/78 mm Hg, and pulse is 78/min and regular. On physical examination, the pupils are reactive to light. Visual acuity is 20/40 in the left eye and 20/100 in the right eye. There is no scalp tenderness. The oropharyngeal mucosa is dry and no lymph nodes are palpable. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. The abdomen is soft and there is no organomegaly. Upper and lower limb deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Muscle power is 5/5 in all extremities.

"explanation": "This patient's presentation is highly concerning for giant cell arteritis (GCA) given his systemic symptoms (fatigue, loss of appetite), headaches, jaw claudication, amaurosis fugax (acute unilateral vision loss), normocytic anemia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Ophthalmology consultation and a temporal artery biopsy, which confirms the diagnosis, are required; however, high-dose systemic glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) should be given immediately to prevent complications (eg, optic neuropathy causing blindness) while awaiting biopsy results. Low-dose aspirin is also recommended to reduce risk of cranial ischemic complications (eg, stroke). Early symptoms of GCA are often nonspecific, and elderly patients may not come for evaluation until visual symptoms develop. Jaw claudication (eg, pain with chewing), seen in up to 50% of cases, has high specificity for GCA; temporal artery swelling and tenderness are helpful findings, but many patients have no scalp tenderness. Although ESR elevation increases the likelihood of diagnosis, GCA and polymyalgia rheumatica (shoulder/neck/hip girdle aching and morning stiffness) can occur with a normal ESR (up to 20% of cases in some series). Conversely, although these conditions do not cause a rise in muscle enzyme (eg, creatine kinase) levels, elderly patients frequently have comorbid diagnoses or medications (eg, statins) causing elevations in these enzymes; therefore, a mildly elevated creatine kinase cannot be used to rule out GCA. (Choice A) If patients develop a thrombotic stroke while on aspirin, dipyridamole can be added. (Choices B and C) This patient has known carotid atherosclerosis and a recent transient ischemic attack. MR angiography is helpful in diagnosing carotid dissection and carotid stenosis, and carotid endarterectomy would be considered in a symptomatic man with >=50% stenosis. Although carotid atherosclerosis can cause amaurosis fugax, this patient's constitutional symptoms, elevated ESR, and jaw claudication are more consistent with GCA; empiric glucocorticoid therapy is the most appropriate next step. (Choice E) Heparin would be beneficial for ophthalmic circulation in embolic stroke; however, this patient is already anticoagulated on dabigatran, and the systemic symptoms and jaw pain make GCA more likely than stroke. Educational objective: Clinical features of giant cell arteritis include systemic symptoms, headaches, jaw claudication, and amaurosis fugax. Inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are usually elevated. Temporal artery biopsy is the preferred confirmatory test, but patients should be started on immediate high-dose glucocorticoids to prevent vision loss while awaiting biopsy results.",

"explanation": "This patient is likely presenting with an acute ischemic embolic stroke to the left superior division of the middle cerebral artery secondary to atrial fibrillation. This patient has received IV tPA therapy, and therefore his blood pressure in the first 24 hours must be maintained < 180/105 mm Hg to reduce the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. (Choice A) Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic that is used for chemical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. In this case, cardioversion will increase the risk of further cardioembolic events from re-establishment of the atrial kick. (Choice B) Aspirin should be avoided in the first 24 hours after IV tPA administration. Following the initial 24-hour period, aspirin may be started if the repeat non-contrast head CT shows no bleeding and the patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation for the atrial fibrillation.

"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient with diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presents with horizontal and vertical binocular diplopia, ptosis, and a nonreactive pupil has an isolated, acute, non-pupil-sparing third nerve palsy. Injury to the third nerve can occur anywhere along its length, from its origin in the brainstem to the orbit. The parasympathetic fibers responsible for pupil constriction (by controlling the sphincter papillae muscle) run on the outside of the third nerve fascicle and are less susceptible to ischemia but are almost invariably affected by an extrinsic mass. Therefore, third nerve palsies are classically classified as follows: Non-pupil-sparing third nerve palsies are frequently caused by mass effect (eg, intracranial aneurysm, tumor). Aneurysms arise from vessels that have a close anatomic relationship with the third nerve (eg, posterior cerebral artery, superior cerebellar artery, posterior communicating artery). A non-pupil-sparing third nerve palsy (as seen in this patient) should be considered due to an aneurysm until proved otherwise; patients should undergo immediate MR or CT angiography for evaluation. Pupil-sparing third nerve palsies are typically caused by microvascular ischemia; they are associated with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and advanced age. Observation and supportive care may be appropriate in patients with vasculopathic risk factors (eg, diabetes, hypertension), although some physicians advocate for imaging to exclude mass effect with all third nerve palsies (Choice E). It is important to note that aneurysms may spare the pupil early in the course and that, rarely, patients with microvascular disease may develop complete infarction with pupillary involvement. Therefore, imaging should be considered if the presentation is atypical (eg, if patients develop a pupil-sparing third nerve palsy without having vasculopathic risk factors, if symptoms fail to improve within 6-12 weeks). (Choice B) Non-pupil-sparing third nerve palsy can be caused by an acute brainstem or lacunar stroke; however, patients typically have other deficits. In the case of an isolated non-pupil-sparing third nerve palsy, aneurysmal compression of the third nerve must be ruled out first. If vascular imaging does not reveal an aneurysm, then an MRI of the brain with diffusion protocol can be considered to rule out a small infarct. (Choice C) Myasthenia gravis presents with fluctuating diplopia; the presence of acetylcholine receptor antibodies can confirm the diagnosis. However, the pupillary light reflex is spared, and pain is not a typical feature in myasthenia gravis. (Choice D) Myopathy affecting the extraocular muscles can occur in rare conditions (eg, muscular dystrophy) and causes elevated creatine phosphokinase and aldolase levels. Myopathies typically present with bilateral symptoms affecting skeletal muscles; pupillary light reflex is spared. Educational objective: Non-pupil-sparing third nerve palsies are most concerning for aneurysmal compression; MR or CT angiography should be performed immediately. Pupil-sparing third nerve palsies are most commonly caused by microvascular ischemia associated with diabetes mellitus.",

"choice_b": "Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis",
"choice_c": "Complex migraine",
"choice_d": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage",
"choice_e": "Vertebral dissection",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation suggests acute traumatic left internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection causing ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and ipsilateral Horner syndrome. Vascular dissections commonly cause acute stroke in patients age <55 and are categorized as traumatic or spontaneous (Table). ICA dissection leads to blood entering between the inner and outer arterial layers, which can form blood clots and also lead to embolic stroke. Non-ischemic ICA dissection typically presents with a thunderclap headache (reaching maximal intensity in < 1 minute) that radiates to the neck. Ischemic dissections may present with transient vision loss, ischemic stroke, or embolic stroke. Because post-ganglionic sympathetic fibers run on the outer surface of the ICA to supply the head, ICA dissection may damage these fibers and lead to partial ipsilateral Horner syndrome (partial ptosis and miosis without anhidrosis). Neck imaging (MRA/CTA is preferred) may show the ICA with a tapered, flame-shaped appearance rather than the blunted-stump appearance of vascular occlusions (Figure). Prompt recognition and treatment (eg, anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, and endovascular or surgical endovascular repair) can decrease the risk of stroke, neurologic disability, and death. (Choice B) Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis can present with thunderclap or gradual headache associated with focal neurologic deficits. However, it usually does not present with Horner syndrome. (Choice C) Complex migraine is considered a diagnosis of exclusion and can present with throbbing headache associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and focal neurologic deficits. However, the headache is rarely described as a thunderclap and is not associated with Horner syndrome. (Choice D) Subarachnoid hemorrhage can present with a thunderclap headache and meningeal signs but usually does not present with Horner syndrome. (Choice E) Vertebral dissection can present with thunderclap headache, Horner syndrome due to infarction of the ipsilateral dorsolateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome), loss of sensation on the face and contralateral body, nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. However, aphasia and weakness are not typically seen in this condition. Educational objective: ICA dissection typically occurs after head or neck trauma with acute neurologic deficits, headache that may radiate to the neck, and possible Horner syndrome. MRA/CTA of the neck is preferred to diagnose vascular dissection (ICA or vertebral), which typically has a flame-shaped, tapered appearance. Prompt recognition and treatment can decrease the risk of stroke, neurologic disability, and death.",

"choice_a": "Atropine response testing",
"choice_b": "Bedside apnea testing",
"choice_c": "Cerebral blood flow testing",
"choice_d": "EEG with electrocerebral inactivity protocol",
"choice_e": "No further testing is needed",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "When clinical criteria suggest brain death, the best next step is apnea testing. Patients must be hemodynamically stable with a body temperature >36 C (97 F), normal pH, and normal PaCO2/PaO2 levels. Apnea testing objectively confirms brainstem failure if the patient cannot generate spontaneous breaths or trigger the ventilator in response to elevated PaCO2 levels > 10 minutes after disabling control mode (Choice E). Patients are first pre-oxygenated with 100% oxygen for 10 minutes using existing ventilatory support, and then mechanical ventilation is discontinued. However, they should continue to passively receive 100% oxygen while the chest and abdomen are observed for spontaneous respirations for approximately 10 minutes. If spontaneous respirations are observed, the apnea test is negative and the patient is not brain dead. A positive test is defined as no spontaneous respirations and requires another clinical brain death examination for confirmation. In addition, repeat ABG must confirm that the PaCO2 was >60 mm Hg or that it increased >20 mm Hg from the baseline ABG. Patients who cannot tolerate apnea testing or have inconclusive results require ancillary diagnostic tests to confirm brain death. (Choice A) The atropine response test involves administering atropine and observing for an increase in heart rate (>3%). Although the vagal nucleus in the medulla may be one of the last functions lost in brain death, the atropine response test provides a limited assessment and has not been well validated for confirming brain death. (Choice C) Cerebral blood flow testing (e.g., cerebral angiogram or cerebral scintigraphy) is the gold standard test for brain death confirmation, but it is highly invasive and not used routinely as the initial step for diagnosing brain death. Cerebral blood flow testing may be used in patients with an unreliable clinical examination or bedside apnea test. (Choice D) Current guidelines do not recommend EEG with ECI protocol for brain death confirmation, as it is susceptible to excessive artifact from other electrical devices in the ICU that make it less reliable. In addition, EEG is very sensitive to the effects of sedative medications and metabolic derangements, and therefore can be easily confounded by those variables. Educational objective: Brain death can be suggested by clinical criteria (e.g., coma, absent cranial nerve reflexes and motor responses, CT/MRI brain imaging consistent with a devastating CNS event, etc.). Two clinical brain death examinations and apnea testing are recommended and considered appropriate for brain death diagnosis. Every attempt should be made to remove all confounding variables that can interfere with obtaining a reliable clinical examination and bedside apnea test.",

His daily medications include aspirin, metformin, and lisinopril. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He does not drink alcohol. He is married and works as an accountant. His family history is significant for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. His blood pressure is 143/95 mm Hg and pulse is 90/min with regular rhythm. His general physical and neurological examinations are unremarkable. An MRI of the brain without contrast reveals a chronic infarct in the right basal ganglia without any evidence of intracranial bleeding. This patient is at the highest risk for which of the following?",
"choice_a": "Dementia",
"choice_b": "Migraine headaches",
"choice_c": "Multiple sclerosis",
"choice_d": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus",
"choice_e": "Seizure disorder",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient's brain MRI shows a silent, chronic lacunar infarct in the right basal ganglia related to his hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Given his vascular risk factors, he is at risk of having additional ischemic events. These events can accumulate over time and cause significant damage to the surrounding white matter tracts and subcortical grey matter, which are essential for proper cognitive function. One study found that patients with silent infarcts with positive brain imaging have double the risk of developing dementia over the subsequent 5 years, compared to normal controls with normal brain imaging. Multiple silent infarcts were associated with an even higher risk than single infarcts. Therefore, this patient is at risk for developing vascular (Binswanger's) dementia in the future. (Choice B) Migraine headaches are a common primary headache disorder typically afflicting patients between the ages of 15-50 years. Migraine headaches (especially those associated with prolonged negative aura) can lead to migrainous cerebral infarction from headache-induced changes in vascular tone or caliber. However, vascular risk factors and stroke have not been linked to a higher future risk of developing migraine headaches. (Choice C) Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that predominantly affects the central white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Vascular risk factors and stroke have not been linked with an increased future risk of developing multiple sclerosis. (Choice D) Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a disorder characterized by ataxia, dementia, and urinary incontinence. This condition develops as a result of impaired cerebrospinal fluid absorption at the arachnoid granulations and has no causal relationship with ischemic events in the brain. (Choice E) The risk of developing seizures following an acute stroke is approximately 5-10% if the stroke involves the cortex. Subcortical strokes typically do not increase the risk of seizures. Severe concussions (e.g., associated with loss of consciousness or amnesia) can lead to a high risk of developing epilepsy later in life. However, this patient only had a mild concussion, and therefore has a low risk for epilepsy. Educational objective: Elderly people with silent brain infarcts have an increased risk of developing dementia than those without such lesions.",

SAH has a mortality rate of nearly 10% before patients reach the hospital and 25% within the first 24 hours of presentation. Rebleeding is the major cause of death within the first 24 hours, particularly within the first 6 hours. The initial step in managing suspected SAH is conventional angiogram as soon as possible with an endovascular approach (eg, coiling and/or stenting) to stabilize the aneurysm. (Choice A) Anti-fibrinolytic therapy (eg, tranexamic acid, epsilon aminocaproic acid) has not been shown to be effective in preventing rebleeding in patients with SAH. (Choices C and D) Hyperdynamic therapy (modest hemodilution, induced hypertension, hypervolemia) and nimodipine can effectively reduce the risk of vasospasm. However, this usually does not occur until after day 3. This patient's clinical course within the first 24 hours of SAH is most likely due to rebleeding. (Choice E) Ventricular drain placement is helpful in reducing intracranial pressure and increasing cerebral perfusion pressure. However, this patient's catastrophic event is likely due to rebleeding.

Laboratory results show Creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, Glucose 80 mg/dL, and Urinalysis with Protein +1 and Red blood cells 10-20/hpf. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's headache?",
"choice_a": "Brain metastasis",
"choice_b": "Hypertensive encephalopathy",
"choice_c": "Non-communicating hydrocephalus",
"choice_d": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage",
"choice_e": "Viral encephalitis",
"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation of hypertension, hematuria, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, and bilateral flank masses suggests likely autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Major extrarenal complications of ADPKD are: Intracranial aneurysms, Hepatic and pancreatic cysts, Cardiac valve disease and aortic root dilatation, Diverticulosis. Nearly 5% of young adults and 20% of patients > age 60 with ADPKD develop intracranial aneurysms that can rupture causing intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage. This risk is higher in patients with family history of ruptured aneurysms. Patients typically present with \"thunderclap\" headache, nausea, and vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) scan usually diagnoses subarachnoid hemorrhage but can sometimes miss small bleeds. Lumbar puncture is indicated in patients with negative CT scan and usually shows xanthochromia. Angiography is recommended for patients with positive CT scan or lumbar puncture. (Choice A) Uncontrolled hypertension, sudden-onset headache, and neck stiffness suggest possible subarachnoid hemorrhage. Bilateral flank masses in this situation indicate underlying ADPKD rather than renal cell carcinoma with metastasis. (Choice B) Although this patient may be at risk for hypertensive encephalopathy, her low-grade fever and neck stiffness indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage. Low-grade fever in general is common with intracranial hemorrhage. Her blood pressure is also not severe enough to cause hypertensive encephalopathy (>180/120 mm Hg). (Choice C) Obstructive or non-communicating hydrocephalus is usually caused by space-occupying lesions. (Choice E) Although this patient's fever and neck stiffness can be due to viral meningitis/encephalitis, the bilateral flank masses, hematuria, and renal insufficiency make ADPKD more likely. Educational objective: Intracranial aneurysms occur in up to 20% of individuals with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.",

"choice_c": "Intermittent pneumatic compression device",
"choice_d": "Low-molecular-weight heparin",
"choice_e": "Thigh-high graduated compression stockings",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a significant problem in patients with acute stroke, occurring in up to 15% of patients within the first 30 days, with pulmonary embolism (PE) accounting for up to 25% of all early deaths following stroke. DVTs can develop as soon as 24 hours after the acute event, with peak incidence at days 2-7. Risk factors in stroke patients include hemiparesis (with the risk proportionate to the degree of hemiparesis), atrial fibrillation, immobility, and advanced age. Pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis is recommended for ischemic stroke but is contraindicated for hemorrhagic stroke in the acute setting. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) initiated within 72 hours of an acute stroke prevented DVT in the open-label CLOTS 3 trial. Patients who have been immobilized for more than 72 hours should not be started on IPC without first ruling out DVT due to possible clot dislodgement associated with IPC. (Choices A and E) Graduated compression stockings have not been shown to reduce the risk of proximal lower-extremity DVT after stroke. DVT was more common in stroke patients wearing below-knee-high compared with thigh-high graduated compression stockings in the CLOTS 2 trial. In contrast, thigh-high graduated compression stockings may be harmful (eg, skin breaks, blisters, skin necrosis) in stroke patients, according to the CLOTS 1 trial. (Choice B) D-dimer surveillance is not recommended as primary screening prophylaxis for DVT in patients with acute stroke. (Choice D) Pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin may be considered 1-4 days following hemorrhagic stroke in immobile patients as long as repeat imaging rules out further bleeding. Educational objective: In patients with hemorrhagic stroke, intermittent pneumatic compression started within 72 hours of the acute event is effective in preventing deep-vein thrombosis (DVT).",

"explanation": "This patient's acute presentation of worsening confusion and agitated behavior in the setting of a urinary tract infection is consistent with delirium. Initial management of delirium involves the treatment of reversible causes, followed by nonpharmacologic measures such as frequent verbal orientation, reassurance, and touch by someone familiar to the patient (eg, family member) or by a trained sitter at the bedside. Pharmacotherapy is reserved for situations in which nonpharmacologic strategies fail or the patient poses a significant risk of harm to self or others. Preferred agents include first- and second-generation antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone) (Choice A). Short-term use is advised as these agents are associated with increased mortality in patients with dementia. Physical restraints are a last resort as they can lead to worsening agitation and result in impaired mobility and pressure ulcers (Choice C). (Choice B) Benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam) can worsen confusion and cause paradoxical agitation. They are reserved for patients in alcohol withdrawal or those who have contraindications to antipsychotics.

Patients in myasthenic crisis can have generalized weakness, respiratory symptoms, or severe oropharyngeal weakness that results in dysphagia and aspiration. Common precipitants include infection and surgery. Patients should be monitored in the intensive care unit, with respiratory status checks every 2-4 hours using vital capacity and maximal inspiratory force. Plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are mainstays in initial therapy due to their relatively rapid onset of action, although benefits are transient: These therapies exert their effects within days and have a maximal effect at 3 weeks. Glucocorticoids are added to provide longer-term symptom relief as their onset of action occurs later, at 2-3 weeks, with a peak effect at 5.5 months. However, treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids alone is associated with a transient worsening of MG symptoms and should be initiated only with plasma exchange or IVIG (Choice A). Patients who cannot tolerate glucocorticoids can be started on azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclosporine, although these drugs have a delayed time of onset compared with glucocorticoids. (Choice B) Trials for using methotrexate as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in generalized MG are ongoing. However, it is not indicated for myasthenic crisis.

A few weeks later he experienced similar symptoms in his hands. Over the last 2 months he has been having increasing difficulty rising from a chair, going up stairs, and lifting objects. He does not have slurred speech, difficulty breathing, changes in vision, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or back pain. His neurological examination reveals symmetric, proximal and distal, and upper and lower extremity muscle weakness associated with atrophy. He has reduced vibration, proprioception, and pinprick sensation that is worse in the legs compared to his arms. His reflexes are diminished in the upper extremities and absent in the lower extremities. Plantar responses are flexor bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

(Choice A) ALS involves both upper and lower motor neuron signs; this patient lacks hyperreflexia or Babinski signs. (Choice C) Diabetic polyneuropathy is usually predominantly distal and very slowly progressive over years; it wouldn't typically cause this degree of proximal weakness in this timeframe. (Choice D) Guillain-Barré (AIDP) has a much more rapid onset (nadir in 3-4 weeks). (Choice E) Lambert-Eaton involves proximal weakness that improves with activity; reflexes are often absent but sensory function is preserved.

Up to 18% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have evidence of nerve damage at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that prediabetes is associated with neuropathy. In addition, up to 50% of patients diagnosed with idiopathic peripheral neuropathy have prediabetes. Early detection is important as the incidence of diabetic neuropathy increases with time, and complications (eg, foot ulcer, Charcot arthropathy) may follow. Patients typically have numbness, paresthesias, and/or burning of the feet that insidiously spread in a stocking-glove distribution. Initially, sensation involving pain/temperature and vibration/proprioception may be impaired. Patients can also have diminished or absent ankle reflexes early in the disease. Frank muscle weakness may be a later finding in severe cases. (Choice A) Folic acid deficiency may cause megaloblastic anemia, but it is not typically associated with neurologic abnormalities such as peripheral neuropathy. (Choice C) Plasma cell dyscrasias are usually seen in older adults with symptoms of anemia, bone pain, fatigue, and renal disease.

In the absence of known exposure to heavy metals, more common causes (eg, diabetes) should be ruled out. Educational objective: Diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in adults and may be associated with prediabetes. Early signs can include impaired sensation (eg, pain/temperature, vibration/proprioception) involving the feet and diminished ankle reflexes. Motor weakness may occur in advanced cases.",

"explanation": "This patient, with lower-extremity discomfort, urge to move the legs when falling asleep, and nocturnal leg movements, has typical features of restless leg syndrome (RLS). Clinically, RLS is characterized by an irresistible urge to move one's body, typically the legs, to stop uncomfortable or odd sensations. The symptoms are worsened by attempts at relaxation and falling asleep. RLS is more common in middle-aged and older patients, as well as those with chronic kidney disease and/or iron deficiency anemia. First-line treatment in RLS includes dopaminergic agonists (ropinirole, pramipexole), with gabapentin considered in refractory cases. Levodopa may also be considered for patients who only need occasional treatment. Supplemental interventions that may be considered include iron supplementation (if low ferritin), leg massage, warm or cold compresses, sleep hygiene measures, and regular exercise. (Choice A) Benztropine is an anticholinergic drug indicated for the treatment of parkinsonism and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders. It has not been well studied for use in RLS. (Choice B) Benzodiazepines and opiates are helpful in RLS, but sedation and tolerance limit their use. They are used primarily as second-line therapy or for patients with only occasional symptoms. (Choice C) Clozapine and other dopamine receptor blockers (eg, haloperidol) may not help RLS and could worsen symptoms. (Choice E) Valproic acid has been studied for use in RLS, but evidence is limited and potential toxicity likely outweighs benefit for most patients. Educational objective: Dopaminergic agonists (ropinirole, pramipexole) are the mainstays of treatment for restless leg syndrome.",

"choice_b": "Carcinomatous meningitis",
"choice_c": "Dementia with Lewy bodies",
"choice_d": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension",
"choice_e": "Normal-pressure hydrocephalus",
"correct_answer": "E",
"explanation": "This patient likely has normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Idiopathic NPH usually occurs in individuals age >60. Secondary NPH can occur in any age group and is usually due to subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis leading to impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption. The classic triad of NPH is gait instability, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. Patients usually present with a history of falls and complaints of feet being fixed to the floor. Urinary incontinence is a late feature. Gait appears similar to that of Parkinsonism except that in NPH it is more wide based (versus narrow based in Parkinson disease). Increased tone or brisk reflexes in the lower extremities and depressed affect indicate pressure on the frontal and prefrontal cortex from enlarged ventricles. The pull-back test and Mini-Mental State Examination may be abnormal but are nonspecific. Subcortical and frontal dysfunctions are more prominent without cortical dysfunction (eg, aphasia and apraxia). Magnetic resonance is a better imaging technique than computed tomography for evaluation of NPH and shows enlarged ventricles out of proportion to sulcal enlargement. The Miller Fisher test (lumbar tap test) confirms the diagnosis of NPH and also helps select patients for treatment. It involves removing 30-50 mL of cerebrospinal fluid via lumbar tap and observing for symptomatic improvement in gait and cognitive function about an hour after the procedure. NPH treatment involves ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, with clinical improvement in about 60% of patients. (Choice A) Alzheimer disease presents with a slowly progressive dementia that affects memory out of proportion to other cognitive functioning. Patients also have difficulty with cortical functions (eg, aphasia, apraxia), which is not usually seen in NPH patients. Gait disturbance is usually a late feature. (Choice B) Acute myeloid leukemia, but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia, is a common cause of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Carcinomatous meningitis usually presents with both focal (eg, cranial nerve palsies, focal weakness) and global symptoms (eg, headache, nausea, vomiting). Symptoms typically develop acutely, over days to weeks. Examination shows multifocal involvement (eg, diplopia, absent knee reflex). (Choice C) Dementia with Lewy bodies presents with progressive cognitive decline, Parkinsonian features (eg, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity), and prominent visual hallucinations. (Choice D) Idiopathic intracranial hypertension usually presents with headaches and papilledema on examination. Lumbar puncture (done after neuroimaging) usually shows high opening pressures (>250 mm H2O). Neuroimaging does not usually show enlarged ventricles, as seen in this patient. Educational objective: The classic triad of normal-pressure hydrocephalus is cognitive dysfunction, gait difficulty, and urinary incontinence. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging showing enlarged ventricles and symptomatic improvement after removal of 30-50 mL of cerebrospinal fluid via lumbar puncture.

Seven days ago, he felt shooting pains in his feet and legs followed by bilateral leg weakness. He reports difficulty with ambulation and getting out of a chair. He has no fever, chills, vision changes, dysphagia, bladder or bowel problems, back pain, muscle tenderness, or dark urine. His past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and lovastatin. His blood pressure is 144/86 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min and regular.

"explanation": "This patient with symmetric, ascending muscle weakness and absent deep-tendon reflexes after recent infectious illness most likely has Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). About 10% of patients with GBS present with arm or facial weakness instead of leg weakness. More than 80% of patients complain of paresthesias in the hands and feet; however, sensory examination is frequently normal. About two-thirds of patients complain of severe pain in the back and extremities. Diagnosis is made clinically as well as with lumbar puncture and neurophysiology studies (eg, EMG). Typical lumbar puncture findings include elevated CSF protein with normal WBC count (albuminocytologic dissociation), which is seen in 80-90% of patients within 1 week after onset of symptoms. EMG and nerve conduction studies may show evidence of polyneuropathy. GBS prognosis is generally good. However, nearly 25% of affected individuals require mechanical ventilation and up to 20% of severely affected individuals remain unable to walk 6 months after symptom onset. Treatment involves supportive care plus plasmapheresis or IVIG, which can accelerate recovery. Educational objective: Guillain-Barré syndrome usually presents after recent infectious illness with ascending symmetrical weakness, loss of reflexes, and no significant sensory loss. Diagnosis is made clinically with neurophysiology studies as well as lumbar puncture showing high protein with normal WBC count (90% patients).

Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cervical degenerative disk disease. The patient has a 30-pack-year smoking history. She is retired and knits frequently as a hobby. Her blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg and pulse is 88/min. Examination of the right hand reveals decreased sensation to pain and temperature along the ventral aspect of the first 3 digits and the radial half of the fourth digit. Sensation over the thenar eminence is preserved. There is no muscle weakness or atrophy. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",
"choice_a": "Brain MRI",
"choice_b": "Cervical spine MRI",
"choice_c": "Nerve conduction studies",
"choice_d": "Surgery referral",
"choice_e": "Wrist splint",
"correct_answer": "E",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as she has subjective pain/paresthesias in the median nerve distribution. Symptoms of CTS are frequently worse at night and can be exacerbated by repetitive/sustained hand movements (eg, knitting). Preservation of sensation over the thenar eminence is highly indicative as the palmar sensory cutaneous branch of the median nerve goes over, not through, the carpal tunnel. Provocative maneuvers such as the Phalen and Tinel tests have limited sensitivity (~60%) and specificity (~70%). CTS is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) are usually performed during atypical presentations, to evaluate disease severity, and prior to considering surgery (sensitivity 56%-85%, specificity 94%). Electromyography is often done with NCS to differentiate neurogenic versus myopathic weakness. Neither of these studies is necessary in this patient as her symptoms are mild and her presentation is typical of CTS (Choice C). Patients with mild-to-moderate disease can have short-term symptom relief with conservative measures (20%-93% success rate) such as wrist splinting and injectable corticosteroids. Decompressive surgery might result in long-term improvement (75% success rate) and should be considered in patients with severe disease or in those who have failed conservative measures (Choice D). (Choice A) Although this patient has risk factors for stroke (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking), a brain MRI will not likely be useful as her focal sensory deficits follow a median nerve distribution. Patients with lacunar stroke of the thalamus can present with pure sensory loss; however, symptoms/signs typically occur on one side of the body (eg, face, arm, and leg). (Choice B) Cervical radiculopathy can present with pain and paresthesias in the hand; however, symptoms would follow a dermatomal pattern as opposed to a median nerve pattern. Educational objective: Carpal tunnel syndrome is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Electrodiagnostic studies are usually performed during atypical presentations, to evaluate disease severity, and prior to considering surgery. Mild-to-moderate cases can be treated conservatively (eg, wrist splinting, injectable corticosteroids).",

"choice_b": "Medication overuse headache",
"choice_c": "Meniere disease",
"choice_d": "Multiple sclerosis",
"choice_e": "Open-angle glaucoma",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient has the following characteristic features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), or pseudotumor cerebri: Chronic pulsatile headache exacerbated by lying flat and improved by sitting up; \"Whooshing\" or wind-like tinnitus; Papilledema with blurring of the optic disk margins. Other common features of IIH may include blurry vision or vision loss and horizontal binocular diplopia. IIH is typically seen in young obese women and is believed to be caused by either excess cerebrospinal fluid production or inadequate absorption. Neuroimaging (ie, MRI) should be performed to exclude other causes of increased intracranial pressure (eg, metastatic lesions, venous sinus thrombosis, obstructive hydrocephalus) but will usually show only normal findings or minor nonspecific abnormalities. If imaging is normal, the diagnosis can be confirmed with lumbar puncture showing elevated opening pressure (>200-250 mm H2O). Initial management for most cases of IIH is acetazolamide and weight loss. Some patients will require the addition of loop diuretics, and surgery is occasionally needed to relieve intracranial pressure. The primary risk of untreated IIH is loss of vision due to optic nerve injury. (Choice B) Medication overuse headache typically occurs after daily exposure (>15 days/month) to an analgesic medication (especially opiates). It is not associated with papilledema. (Choice C) Meniere disease, or endolymphatic hydrops, is a disorder of the inner ear that results from overproduction or under-absorption of endolymph. Patients will typically develop tinnitus in one ear associated with ear fullness and progressive sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo. Papilledema, blurry vision, and headache are not associated with Meniere disease. (Choice D) Multiple sclerosis is a relapsing-remitting autoimmune disease caused by demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system that are disseminated in space and time. Attacks can manifest as optic neuritis, characterized by acute headache with unilateral blurry vision and papilledema/papillitis. Chronic headaches and bilateral papilledema are not typical of acute optic neuritis from multiple sclerosis. (Choice E) Open-angle glaucoma accounts for 90% of glaucoma cases in the United States. It presents clinically with gradual painless loss of vision rather than acute attacks. Funduscopy may show characteristic optic nerve changes (such as increased cup-to-disk ratio). Tonometry usually shows elevated intraocular pressures. Papilledema is not usually seen with open-angle glaucoma but can be seen with closed-angle glaucoma due to very high intraocular pressures. Educational objective: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) is characterized by chronic pulsatile headaches, often associated with \"whooshing\" tinnitus. The headaches are worsened by lying flat. Funduscopy should be performed to evaluate for the presence of papilledema, which suggests elevated intracranial pressure. If neuroimaging is negative, the diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring opening pressure on lumbar puncture.",

"choice_c": "Guillain-Barre syndrome",
"choice_d": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus",
"choice_e": "Transverse myelitis",
"correct_answer": "B",
"explanation": "Cervical spondylosis is a progressive degenerative process of the cervical vertebral bodies and discs (most common in adults age >55) that can result in disc herniation, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy of the posterior longitudinal ligament and ligament flava. These processes can lead to cervical spinal canal stenosis, mechanical spinal cord compression (in about 5-10% of individuals), and spinal cord ischemia (due to compression of the arterial and venous supplies of the cord). Flexion and extension of the neck can exacerbate cord compression while extension of the neck (which may occur when this patient bicycles) reduces the diameter of the spinal canal and causes inward buckling of the ligamentum flavum. Both MRI and CT can be used to diagnose cervical cord compression. MRI is preferred since it provides better intramedullary detail of the spinal cord while CT gives better images of bone and calcified tissues. There should be careful clinical and anatomic correlation since there is a high frequency of MRI abnormalities of the cervical spine in asymptomatic older individuals. Conservative treatment with cervical immobilization is indicated for mild myelopathy while surgical decompression is reserved for patients who fail conservative measures, severe myelopathy or progressing deficits, or acute deterioration with cord compression. (Choice A) Both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cervical cord compression can occur in older individuals and produce a combination of upper and lower motor neuron findings. ALS generally has lower motor neuron deficits and fasciculations in the lower extremities and cranial muscles, while cervical cord compression has deficits isolated to the affected dermatome. ALS usually does not cause sensory deficits while cervical cord compression may have subtle or absent sensory deficits. This patient does exhibit some sensory deficits, which would make ALS unlikely. An electromyogram, which usually documents denervation in ALS, may be helpful to distinguish between the two disorders. (Choice C) Chronic or subacute Guillain Barré syndrome can present as progressive upper and lower extremity weakness, but reflexes are lost or diminished in contrast to the hyperreflexia seen in this patient. (Choice D) The combination of gait impairment and urinary symptoms may suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus; however, this patient does not have cognitive dysfunction which is usually seen with normal pressure hydrocephalus. (Choice E) Transverse myelitis usually occurs in a younger population and presents with a segmental cord syndrome, which is not present in this case. Spinal cord MRI and cerebral spinal fluid analysis are required for diagnosis of transverse myelitis. Educational objective: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a relatively common and potentially treatable cause of progressive disability in older adults. This condition often presents with upper motor neuron signs in the lower extremities and lower motor neuron signs in the upper extremities. MRI is the diagnostic study of choice.",

His medical problems include hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis of the left hip. He underwent gastric bypass surgery 5 weeks ago for morbid obesity. Neurological examination shows a left foot drop with strength in the left leg as follows: dorsiflexion 1/5, foot eversion 2/5, foot inversion 5/5, and plantar flexion 5/5. Sensory examination shows decreased pin prick sensation over the dorsum of the left foot. The remainder of the neurological examination is unremarkable.

"choice_b": "Mid-thigh",
"choice_c": "Sciatic notch",
"choice_d": "Tarsal tunnel",
"choice_e": "Vertebral foramina",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient has most likely injured the left common peroneal nerve in the fibular head region, resulting in a peroneal neuropathy. Risk factors include prolonged immobilization (e.g., surgery or hospitalization), leg crossing, squatting, and leg casting; especially when combined with significant weight loss (e.g., gastric bypass surgery in this patient). Patients typically present with foot drop and paresthesias and/or sensory loss involving the dorsum of the foot and lateral shin. Patients tend to trip over the affected foot and compensate by flexing the hip while walking, leading to a \"steppage\" gait. Examination usually shows weakness on foot dorsiflexion and eversion, and decreased sensation in the dorsum of the foot. However, there is usually a normal Achilles reflex with normal foot inversion and plantar flexion. Treatment involves removing the pressure on the nerve, an ankle-foot orthosis splint to keep the foot dorsiflexed, and physical therapy to improve walking. However, the treatments have variable results with little recovery of function in most cases. (Choice B) A mid-thigh nerve injury may involve the femoral nerve leading to acute thigh weakness and numbness, which this patient does not have. (Choice C) A sciatic notch nerve injury may result in sciatica, which usually causes pain in the sciatic nerve distribution and sensory loss involving both the peroneal and sural nerves. This patient only has peroneal involvement, which makes this less likely. (Choice D) A tarsal tunnel nerve injury compresses the posterior tibial nerve. Symptoms are mainly sensory (i.e., burning pain of the foot and heel, paresthesias, and sensory loss in the sole) with rare foot weakness. This patient's foot weakness makes this unlikely. (Choice E) Lumbar vertebral foraminal nerve root injury causes a lumbar radiculopathy. L5 radiculopathy is associated with weakness of ankle inversion and toe flexion, sensory loss more localized to the big toe region, and a radicular pattern of pain. Educational objective: Peroneal neuropathy is usually due to an injury of the nerve at the fibular head and typically presents with foot drop and paresthesias of the dorsum of the foot. Patients usually have normal reflexes and foot inversion, which can help differentiate peroneal neuropathy from other causes of neuropathy in the lower extremity.",

"choice_e": "Transverse myelitis",
"correct_answer": "E",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation suggests transverse myelitis (TM), a rare inflammatory disorder causing segmental spinal cord injury. Most cases of TM are idiopathic, likely due to an autoimmune process following a viral infection (50% of cases). Patients present initially with spinal shock - lower-extremity weakness, flaccidity, areflexia, and absent Babinski sign. There will be a sensory level to all primary sensory modalities. Bowel and bladder dysfunction are present. Some patients also complain of a \"band-like\" squeezing pain. After 1 week, patients usually develop spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and clonus. Diagnosis is suggested by magnetic resonance imaging with contrast, which shows enhancing cord segments with surrounding edema. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis usually shows elevated protein, moderate lymphocytosis, normal glucose, and no oligoclonal bands. Treatment is typically supportive (physical therapy). Intravenous corticosteroids can sometimes help patients with an autoimmune component of the disease. Recovery usually occurs within 3 months, with up to 40% of patients experiencing some residual disability. (Choice A) Cauda equina syndrome affects the lumbosacral roots as they exit the spinal cord and is usually caused by a herniated disk or tumor. Clinically, patients will present with severe unilateral pain in the saddle region that radiates down to the legs with associated asymmetrical lower-extremity weakness (proximal and distal). The presence of significant bowel/bladder/sphincter symptoms clinically distinguishes cauda equina syndrome from Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS); the presence of severe shooting (lancinating) pain distinguishes it from TM. (Choice B) TM can mimic GBS in the setting of spinal shock, as reflexes and Babinski sign will be absent. However, patients with GBS will not have bowel/bladder symptoms or a sensory loss below a spinal cord segment. (Choice C) Spinal cord infarction usually presents with abrupt onset (minutes to hours) of back pain, weakness (and possibly paralysis), loss of sensation and reflexes, and autonomic dysfunction. Onset of symptoms (days) and antecedent viral illness are more suggestive of TM. (Choice D) Vitamin B12 deficiency results in slowly progressive weakness, ataxia, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. This patient's acute onset of symptoms is less consistent with cobalamin deficiency. Educational objective: Acute onset of weakness and sensory loss below a segmental spinal level, paresthesias, and bowel/bladder/sphincter dysfunction suggest transverse myelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast shows enhancing cord segments with surrounding edema. Treatment is mainly supportive and can include intravenous corticosteroids.",

"choice_b": "Frontotemporal dementia",
"choice_c": "Idiopathic Parkinson disease",
"choice_d": "Parkinson-plus syndrome",
"choice_e": "Sporadic spongiform encephalopathy",
"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "This patient likely has multiple system atrophy, a type of Parkinson-plus syndrome. Parkinson-plus syndromes make up approximately 10%-15% of cases of parkinsonism and can generally be distinguished from idiopathic Parkinson disease by the rapid onset of symptoms, symmetric neurologic findings (eg, bradykinesia, rigidity), absent tremor, early autonomic dysfunction (eg, urinary incontinence, orthostatic hypotension), and poor response to dopamine agonists (Choice C). The 3 most common Parkinson-plus syndromes include multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration, and each has a unique set of features. The diagnosis of multiple system atrophy is clinical, incorporating a combination of core findings that include akinetic-rigid parkinsonism, autonomic failure, and cerebellar ataxia (eg, wide-based, unsteady gait). Brain MRI may reveal nonspecific atrophy of the putamen, middle cerebellar peduncle, or pons but is mainly useful in excluding alternate conditions (eg, infarction, tumor). (Choice A) Dementia with Lewy bodies may present with cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, and autonomic dysfunction. However, other core features (eg, visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition/alertness) are not evident in this patient. (Choice B) Frontotemporal dementia typically presents with changes in personality/behavior (eg. emotional blunting, social disinhibition) and language abnormalities (eg, aphasia). Neuroimaging often reveals frontal and temporal lobe atrophy. (Choice E) Sporadic spongiform encephalopathy (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is an infectious prion-mediated neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapidly progressive (<1 year) dementia and myoclonus. Educational objective: Parkinson-plus syndromes (eg, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration) can generally be distinguished from idiopathic Parkinson disease by the rapid onset of symptoms, symmetric neurologic findings, absence of tremor, early autonomic dysfunction, and poor response to levodopa. The hallmark features of multiple system atrophy include akinetic-rigid parkinsonism, autonomic failure, and cerebellar ataxia.",

"choice_b": "Ergotamine",
"choice_c": "Naproxen",
"choice_d": "Sumatriptan",
"choice_e": "Topiramate",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient has typical migraine headaches, with management complicated by pregnancy. Patients with severe symptoms or who are refractory to non-drug therapies (eg, hydration, massage, ice packs) should receive medications with minimal fetal risk. Acetaminophen is preferred due to its low risk of adverse events. Patients not responding to acetaminophen alone may benefit from adding an antiemetic (eg, metoclopramide), codeine, or caffeine/butalbital. However, butalbital and codeine should be used sparingly to avoid medication overuse headache. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen can be used as a 2nd option in patients not responding to acetaminophen but should be used only in brief courses; they are associated with fetal toxicity in the 1st and 3rd trimesters (Choice C). Stronger opioids (eg, oxycodone) are 3rd-line therapy but can be habit-forming and possibly worsen nausea/vomiting and constipation during pregnancy. Parenteral antiemetics can also be considered acutely and can be used as monotherapy for migraines. (Choice B) Ergotamine is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of inducing hypertonic uterine contractions and vasoconstriction, which can lead to adverse fetal effects. (Choice D) The \"triptans\" (eg, sumatriptan) can be considered in patients who are refractory to other therapies. However, some studies have shown an increased risk of vasoconstriction of uteroplacental vessels, increased uterotonic activity, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. (Choice E) Topiramate has been associated with adverse events and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Beta blockers (eg, propranolol) are generally preferred for patients requiring prophylaxis. Educational objective: Acetaminophen is the preferred medication for migraines during pregnancy due to its low risk of adverse events. Other options in patients not responding to acetaminophen include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (2nd trimester), opioids, and antiemetics.",

"choice_c": "Major depressive disorder",
"choice_d": "Mild cognitive impairment",
"choice_e": "Normal aging",

MCI is characterized by cognitive impairment that does not meet criteria for dementia (ie, major neurocognitive disorder) but is more severe than the mild deficits found in normal aging (Choice E). Patients with MCI have noticeable cognitive impairments but are generally able to compensate for their deficits (eg, written reminders) and function independently. One of the most widely used tools to assess for MCI and dementia is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Scores of <26 are highly sensitive for MCI or dementia; however, the MoCA possesses only moderate specificity. MCI is found in 2 subtypes: amnestic (ie, primarily memory impairment) and nonamnestic MCI. Amnestic MCI is twice as prevalent as nonamnestic forms; amnestic MCI more frequently evolves into Alzheimer disease. (Choices A and B) The diagnosis of dementia requires evidence of progressive cognitive decline accompanied by functional impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs); this patient demonstrates independence with ADLs and so does not meet the criteria for dementia. Alzheimer disease frequently presents with prominent early amnestic symptoms whereas dementia with Lewy bodies may present with fluctuating attention/arousal, visual hallucinations, and REM sleep behavior disorder. (Choice C) Although major depressive disorder frequently accompanies cognitive impairment in elderly patients, this patient lacks key features of this disorder (eg, anhedonia, decreased interest in activities). Educational objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by impaired cognition with preserved functioning and independence of activities of daily living.",

"choice_e": "MRI of the head",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with Bell's palsy, an acute peripheral facial nerve paralysis likely due to herpes simplex virus activation in most cases. This patient's sudden onset without other associated symptoms makes Bell's palsy most likely. Nearly 70%-85% of patients recover within 3 weeks, but many studies suggest that prednisone given within 3 days of symptom onset significantly improves recovery. Some studies also suggest that adding valacyclovir may help patients with severe facial paralysis. (Choice B) Electromyography is used to monitor the progression of symptoms. However, it is usually performed days to weeks after symptom onset in patients without improvement to document complete facial paresis and determine chances of recovery. (Choice C) Lumbar puncture may help diagnose meningitis or encephalitis. However, this patient's normal mental status and lack of fever, headache, or nuchal rigidity make these diagnoses less likely. (Choice D) Disseminated Lyme disease may present with facial nerve palsy but usually has other associated features (eg, meningitis, radiculopathy, arthralgias). In addition, Lyme disease occurs more commonly in the upper Midwest and northeastern regions of the United States (eg, Connecticut) instead of Texas. Lyme disease is also more common in the summer months, not in winter. (Choice E) Head MRI is indicated in patients with atypical symptoms/signs, facial twitching or spasm preceding weakness, slow progression of symptoms after 3 weeks, or no symptom improvement after 4 months. Educational objective: Bell's palsy is an acute peripheral facial nerve palsy likely due to herpes simplex virus activation; prednisone given early after symptom onset speeds recovery and enhances outcome.",

"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation (localized semi-purposeful movements, loss of awareness, tonic-clonic movements, and amnesia) is most consistent with a complex partial seizure that has generalized. Complex partial seizures are usually preceded by an aura (sensory symptoms). Unprovoked first seizures require neuroimaging studies to identify structural brain abnormality. Brain MRI is more sensitive than CT in identifying lesions such as cortical dysplasias, infarcts, or tumors. EEG may show abnormal waves but can also be normal after a seizure. Abnormal MRI or EEG after a single seizure indicates a high risk of future recurrent seizures. These patients benefit from antiepileptic drugs. Patients with normal studies have a lower risk of recurrent seizures and generally do not require drugs (Choices B and E). (Choice C) Continuous EEG monitoring is used primarily to detect nonconvulsive seizures, which were not seen in this patient. (Choice D) This patient's presentation is consistent with an epileptic event; he requires diagnostic testing to rule out underlying organic disease before assuming he had a psychogenic nonepileptic seizure.

PHN is defined as persistent pain 4 months after rash onset. Anticonvulsants such as pregabalin or gabapentin are useful in alleviating the pain of PHN and could be considered in this patient. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as nortriptyline and desipramine also have evidence of efficacy but are included in the Beers Criteria for older adults due to side effects. (Choice A) Carbamazepine is the treatment for trigeminal neuralgia; there is no evidence to support its use for PHN. (Choice B) Glucocorticoids have not been proven helpful for PHN.

Cognitively stimulating activities and active social engagement can also slow progression. (Choices A, B, and C) There is no consistent evidence for the benefit of NSAIDs or cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil) in preventing progression from MCI to dementia. Memantine is indicated for moderate to severe Alzheimer disease, not MCI. (Choice E) There is no consistent evidence that vitamin E prevents cognitive decline in MCI, though it may slow progression in established mild-to-moderate AD.

(Choice A) BK virus is associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis in renal transplant patients. (Choice B) Epstein-Barr virus status does not affect the initiation of natalizumab. (Choice C) While fingolimod is associated with increased herpes simplex infections, previous HSV status does not affect natalizumab initiation. (Choice E) Varicella zoster status does not affect treatment with natalizumab. Educational objective: Natalizumab is a second-line agent for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; all patients should have JC virus antibody testing prior to starting therapy due to the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

"explanation": "The patient's normal Rinne test (air conduction > bone conduction) and Weber test lateralizing to the unaffected (left) ear suggest right-sided sensorineural hearing loss. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) is a benign tumor originating from Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve and is the most common tumor causing sensorineural hearing loss. Patients typically present with chronic ipsilateral tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, and balance problems. (Choice A) Acute labyrinthitis presents with abrupt onset severe vertigo and hearing loss that peaks in 1-2 days, making it unlikely for chronic symptoms. (Choice B) Cerebellar stroke causes acute-onset vertigo and ataxia, but hearing is generally preserved. (Choice C) Conversion disorder is considered only after excluding objective medical etiologies; this patient's findings are consistent with a vestibular nerve lesion. (Choice D) Otosclerosis causes conductive hearing loss, which would result in a Weber test lateralizing to the affected ear and an abnormal Rinne test (bone > air) in that ear. Educational objective: Vestibular schwannoma originates from the Schwann cells surrounding the vestibulocochlear nerve and is the most common tumor causing sensorineural hearing loss.",

"explanation": "The patient's presentation is consistent with optic neuritis, characterized by acute vision loss, decreased color perception (especially red), and pain with eye movement. Optic neuritis can be a manifestation of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), the first demyelinating episode of central nervous system dysfunction. All patients with CIS should undergo a brain MRI to evaluate for demyelinating plaques and assess the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). (Choice A) Cerebrovascular disease would be unlikely to cause pain with eye movement and is rare in a young patient.
