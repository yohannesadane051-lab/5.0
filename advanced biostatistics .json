"choice_b": "Marker 2",

"choice_d": "Parallel combination",
"choice_e": "Serial combination",
"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "The negative LR (LR-) represents the value of a negative test result. It is the probability of a patient with the disease testing negative divided by the probability of a patient without the disease testing negative. In general, the smaller the LR, the less likely the disease presence. In this case, the parallel combination has the lowest LR- (LR- = 0.03); therefore, negative test results on the parallel combination gives the strongest evidence against the presence of pancreatic cancer. The parallel combination test also has the highest sensitivity at 98.41%, meaning that patients with pancreatic cancer would have >98% probability of having a positive result on that test. A negative result on a highly sensitive test helps to rule out a disease."

"choice_e": "There was no differential response to mAb therapy depending on Alzheimer disease severity",
"correct_answer": "E",
"explanation": "Heterogeneity testing, such as the Q statistic, helps to exclude differences between groups. The null hypothesis (H0) denotes that there is no difference between the groups studied. A large nonsignificant P value (>0.05) suggests that there is no difference between the groups studied so H0 cannot be rejected. For the Q statistic in this example, H0 represents no difference (no heterogeneity) in response to mAb therapy between patients with mild and moderate Alzheimer disease. The large P values obtained (0.67, 0.86, and 0.94) mean that H0 cannot be rejected. In other words, there was no differential response to mAb therapy depending on disease severity."

For H. pylori infection, the OR of 0.371 means H. pylori infection is associated with lower odds of rebleeding. The inverse of the OR (1/0.371 = ~2.695) represents the odds of rebleeding among patients who are H. pylori-negative divided by the odds of rebleeding among patients who are H. pylori-positive. Because 2.695 > 1, the odds of rebleeding are significantly higher among patients who are H. pylori-negative."

Participants with varying levels and severities of spinal cord injury are randomly assigned to either a 24-week, anti-inflammatory diet treatment group or a control group. Primary outcomes consist of changes in pain scores and markers of inflammation at 6 months. Preliminary analyses reveal a significant reduction in pain scores in the treatment group from baseline to 6 months (p=0.03). There was a significant reduction in pain scores among nonobese subjects (p=0.01) and a nonsignificant increase in pain scores among obese subjects (p=0.06).

In this case, weight status is an effect modifier because the intervention (diet) had a significant effect on pain reduction in nonobese subjects but went in the opposite direction (nonsignificant increase) in obese subjects.
