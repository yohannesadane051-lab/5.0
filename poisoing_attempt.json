"stem": "A 24-year-old man comes to the physician with cold extremities and loss of feeling in his hands. He is a mountaineer who was on an expedition to climb Mt. Rainier. His group became lost in a storm and was stranded at high altitude due to reduced visibility and high winds. The patient had several hours of exposure to very low ambient temperatures before being rescued. He had on 2 pairs of gloves, including a woolen inner pair and an outer shell. However, the outer shell was damaged during the climb. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows that the first through third digits are white, cold, numb, and firm distal to the first interphalangeal joint. The fingers are immersed rapidly in water heated to 38 C (100.4F). After 30 minutes, the fingers are purplish-red between the proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints. Which of the following is the best next step in managing this patient?",
"choice_a": "Hyperbaric oxygen",
"choice_b": "Intravenous thrombolytic therapy",
"choice_c": "Nonadherent gauze dressings",
"choice_d": "Occlusive dressing",
"choice_e": "Prophylactic antibiotics",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "Frostbite is a severe and localized cold-induced injury most commonly affecting the ears, nose, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes. It is further classified as first degree (superficial localized pallor and surrounding edema), second degree (large blisters that may form eschar), third degree (deeper and smaller hemorrhagic blisters), and fourth degree (tissue necrosis extending to muscle and bone). Diagnosis is usually clinical in susceptible individuals (eg, the homeless, mountaineers, soldiers, those stranded or working in the cold). Technetium (Tc)-99 scintigraphy may predict long-term viability of affected tissue. Treatment involves rapid rewarming with water heated to 37-39 C (98.6-102.2 F) (not hot) to reduce tissue damage and analgesics (eg, opioids) for pain control. After thawing is complete (usually in 15-30 minutes), localized tissue usually appears red or purple and is soft to the touch. After rewarming, the affected areas are usually air dried and covered with a first layer of nonadherent gauze using aseptic technique. Other treatment measures include tetanus prophylaxis, possible splinting to prevent contractures, daily hydrotherapy, and elevation of the affected area (to reduce edema). Severe frostbite may require early surgical consultation for possible tissue debridement, escharotomy, or amputation. (Choice A) There is insufficient data on whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy is useful in the treatment of frostbite. (Choice B) Limited evidence for thrombolytics suggests benefit in severe frostbite patients at high risk for life-altering amputation (eg, multiple digits, proximal amputation) and who present ≤24 hours from injury without contraindications to tissue plasminogen activator use. However, clinicians must assess the risk/benefit ratio for each patient. (Choice D) Occlusive dressings may extend tissue damage and are usually avoided. (Choice E) Prophylactic antibiotics are given only for signs of infection, which are not present in this patient. Educational objective: Frostbite is a severe and localized cold-induced injury. It is best treated with rapid rewarming with water temperatures of 37-39 C (98.6-102.2 F). After rewarming, the affected areas are usually air dried and covered with nonadherent gauze. Daily hydrotherapy with subsequent dressing changes and elevation of the affected area aid the healing of superficial frostbite.",

"stem": "A 72-year-old man is scheduled for right knee replacement surgery due to severe osteoarthritis. He has no other medical problems. He takes ibuprofen and occasionally oxycodone for knee pain. He also takes herbal supplements that he purchases from a health food store. Which of the following herbal supplements increases the risk of bleeding in this patient?",
"choice_a": "Echinacea",
"choice_b": "Ephedra",
"choice_c": "Ginkgo biloba",
"choice_d": "Kava",
"choice_e": "St John's wort",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": " This patient is scheduled for knee surgery and admits to use of herbal supplements. Many commonly used herbs may interact with anticoagulants or increase the risk of bleeding (Table). It is generally recommended that patients stop taking supplements known to affect hemostasis at least 14 days prior to scheduled procedures. Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, and saw palmetto are associated with increased bleeding risk and should be stopped before surgery or dental procedures. (Choice A) Echinacea is used as an immune stimulant to protect against the common cold and flu. Prolonged use of the supplement (>10 days) is not recommended. It does not cause bleeding problems, but some studies have shown anaphylaxis in patients with allergy/atopy. (Choice B) Ephedrine was used in the early 1990s for weight loss, improving athletic performance, and treating common colds. It is known to cause elevated blood pressure, fatal arrhythmias, and even sudden death. The sale of ephedra-containing products is now illegal in the United States. (Choice D) Kava is used as an anxiolytic and sedative and also to treat ADHD in children. There have been several cases of severe liver toxicity, including cirrhosis and liver failure, associated with its use. (Choice E) St John's wort has been used for centuries to treat depression. It may cause hypertension and serotonin syndrome when used with antidepressants. It also decreases INR in patients on anticoagulants, and thus drug levels may need close monitoring. Educational objective: Herbal supplements are used frequently by the general population. Many such supplements (eg, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, and saw palmetto) increase risk of bleeding and should be discontinued 14 days prior to surgical procedures.",

"stem": "A 79-year-old man is found poorly responsive in his apartment by a neighbor in the middle of July. The apartment is not air conditioned and the last few days have been extremely hot. The patient's neighbors state that he lives alone and appeared fully functional in their interactions with him. No additional medical history is available. On physical examination, he appears obtunded and responds slowly to commands. His temperature is 42.2° C (108°F), blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient's pulse oximetry shows 96% on room air. Mucous membranes are dry. His neck is supple, and jugular veins are flat in the supine position. Cardiopulmonary examination is within normal limits. There are no skin rashes. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. There is no muscular rigidity. An electrocardiogram demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment changes. A chest film shows no significant abnormalities. Laboratory workup is pending. In addition to volume resuscitation, which of the following is the best initial therapy for this patient?",
"choice_a": "Alcohol sponge baths",
"choice_b": "Aspirin suppositories",
"choice_c": "Dantrolene",
"choice_d": "Evaporative cooling",
"choice_e": "Immersion in ice water",
"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with classic (nonexertional) heat stroke. Nonexertional heat stroke is more common in the elderly and those with chronic medical conditions. Exertional heat stroke is more common in young healthy athletes exercising heavily in high ambient temperature and humidity. Heat stroke mortality is reported as 20%-60%. Hyperthermia management includes supportive measures (eg, airway protection, circulatory support), rapid evaporative cooling, cold IV normal saline boluses for hypotension or volume depletion, cooled oxygen and blankets, and temperature monitoring via rectal or esophageal probes. Evaporated cooling is safe, noninvasive, effective, and does not interfere with other treatment and monitoring. The technique involves spraying mists of water with fans blowing air over moist skin. Ice water immersion is also quick and effective in reducing the body temperature. However, it interferes with monitoring and is associated with increased mortality in elderly patients with classic (nonexertional) heat stroke. Younger patients with exertional heat stroke can better tolerate this technique (Choice E). (Choice A) Alcohol sponge baths should be avoided because large amounts of alcohol may be absorbed through dilated cutaneous blood vessels and lead to systemic toxicity. (Choice B) Antipyretics (eg, acetaminophen, aspirin) are not helpful in heat stroke as the mechanism is not regulated by the hypothalamus. Aspirin may even exacerbate complications such as renal failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation. (Choice C) Dantrolene is effective for treating hyperthermia associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome but is ineffective in other hyperthermic disorders. The absence of muscular rigidity makes neuroleptic malignant syndrome unlikely. Educational objective: Management of classic (nonexertional) heat stroke includes cooling methods (eg, evaporative cooling), circulatory support (with intravenous fluid boluses), airway management, and treatment of complications. Antipyretics and dantrolene are not useful in the management of heat stroke.",

"stem": "A 41-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder is brought to the emergency department by his mother for confusion and agitation that she noticed while visiting today. The patient denies suicidal ideation and intentional overdose of his medication or illicit drugs. His only known medication is lithium. His temperature is 37.2° C (99° F), blood pressure is 94/52 mm Hg, pulse is 89/min, and respirations are 18/min. The patient's pulse oximetry is 96% on room air. Examination shows dry mucous membranes, clear lung fields, and normal first and second heart sounds. The patient has a flat affect and does not answer most questions. He has a significant tremor in both hands.

Intravenous fluids are initiated. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
"choice_a": "Activated charcoal",
"choice_b": "Forced diuresis",
"choice_c": "Hemodialysis",
"choice_d": "Ipecac",
"choice_e": "Whole-bowel irrigation",
"correct_answer": "C",
"explanation": "This patient's presentation (sluggishness, confusion, agitation, and neuromuscular excitability with irregular, coarse tremors) is consistent with acute-on-chronic lithium poisoning. Acute intoxication often presents with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and late development of neurologic symptoms. Chronic lithium toxicity can exhibit neurologic symptoms, but it usually occurs gradually over months or years. Patients taking chronic lithium may also have signs of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or thyroid dysfunction. Serum lithium levels do not always correlate with signs of toxicity, especially in the acute setting. Initial management includes evaluating and stabilizing the airway and circulation. Saline infusion is the first-line therapy to ensure significant lithium clearance. Hemodialysis is indicated for serum lithium levels > 4 mEq/L (4 mmol/L) OR levels >2.5 mEq/L PLUS either signs of significant lithium toxicity (eg, seizures, depressed mental status) or inability to excrete lithium (eg, renal disease, decompensated heart failure). (Choice A) Activated charcoal is not indicated for lithium toxicity as it does not prevent lithium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. (Choice B) Forced diuresis has little clinical effect and may predispose the patient to further volume depletion. (Choice D) Ipecac is not recommended as it can be effective in inducing vomiting but does not necessarily ensure lithium removal. (Choice E) Whole-bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol may be given to awake and asymptomatic patients within 2-3 hours of lithium consumption. Polyethylene glycol may be an alternate therapy to hemodialysis in these patients as it can empty the bowel and decrease toxin absorption. However, it is not beneficial for chronic toxicity. Educational objective: Lithium toxicity should be managed initially by stabilizing the airway and circulation and aggressive saline infusion to ensure significant lithium clearance. Hemodialysis is indicated for serum lithium levels > 4 mEq/L (4 mmol/L) OR levels >2.5 mEq/L PLUS either signs of significant lithium toxicity or inability to excrete lithium.",

"stem": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to 2 days of nausea and vomiting. Her symptoms started a few hours after eating lunch, and she has since been unable to tolerate any oral intake. The patient began to experience epigastric and retrosternal discomfort this morning, and she now has pain in all her joints and muscles. Medical history includes hypertension; type 1 diabetes mellitus; myocardial infarction 2 years ago that was treated with coronary stenting; and severe, degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. Medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, insulin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and morphine. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, pulse is 94/min. and respirations are 18/min. The patient is awake and oriented to time, place, and person. Physical examination is significant for diaphoresis and rhinorrhea. Abdominal examination is significant for epigastric tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds. ECG shows nonspecific ST-T changes. An older ECG is not available for comparison. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's clinical presentation?",
"choice_a": "Acute pancreatitis",
"choice_b": "Hypoglycemia",
"choice_c": "Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction",
"choice_d": "Opioid withdrawal",
"choice_e": "Worsening gastroenteritis",
"correct_answer": "D",
"explanation": "Clinical features of opioid withdrawal: Acute opioid cessation/dose reduction after prolonged use. Clinical presentation: Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping,↑ bowel sounds; Cardiac: pulse,↑ blood pressure, diaphoresis; Psychological: insomnia, yawning, dysphoric mood; Other: myalgias, arthralgias, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, piloerection, mydriasis. Management: Opioid agonist: methadone (preferred) or buprenorphine; Nonopioid: clonidine or adjunctive medications (antiemetics, antidiarrheals, benzodiazepines). This patient likely contracted a foodborne illness after eating lunch. The resultant nausea and vomiting left her unable to tolerate oral intake, causing abrupt cessation of her oral morphine. The development of abdominal cramping, arthralgias, myalgias, diaphoresis, and rhinorrhea 2 days later (when symptoms of acute gastroenteritis should be diminishing) is most likely due to opioid withdrawal. Tolerance to opioids, a prerequisite for withdrawal, generally develops after ≥3 weeks of regular use. Opioid withdrawal typically begins within 3 half-lives of abrupt discontinuation (ie, within 6-12 hours in the case of short-acting morphine; 24-48 hours for long-acting) in patients with prolonged use. Symptoms typically peak within 3 days of last use and may persist for up to 10 days. (Choice A) Although acute pancreatitis may present with nausea, vomiting, and mid-epigastric abdominal pain that radiates to the back, it is rarely associated with diffuse joint and muscle pain. Given the abrupt cessation of morphine, opioid withdrawal better explains the patient's condition. (Choice B) Hypoglycemia may be associated with palpitations, diaphoresis, and anxiety. Hypoglycemia would not explain this patient's presentation. (Choice C) Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) can present with chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting), and diaphoresis. Although this patient has a history of recent MI and may warrant further evaluation (eg, serial troponins), her overall clinical picture and history of opioid use are more consistent with opioid withdrawal. (Choice E) The rapid onset of gastrointestinal symptoms after eating lunch (ie, <6 hours) points to a foodborne, preformed toxin as the cause of this patient's gastroenteritis. However, foodborne illness caused by a preformed toxin rarely persists for >2-3 days, typically peaks in severity within this timeframe, and is rarely associated with diffuse joint and muscle pain. Educational objective: Symptoms of opioid withdrawal generally begin within 1-2 days after abrupt opioid cessation in patients with sustained use (ie, ≥3 weeks). Clinical features include gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, persistent nausea/vomiting), rhinorrhea or lacrimation, diaphoresis, arthralgias, myalgias, mydriasis, and cardiac symptoms (eg, tachycardia).",

"stem": "A 20-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department from a college dorm. She attended a party earlier that night and was brought back to her room by her roommate. The roommate told paramedics that she called for an ambulance because the patient was agitated, combative, and \"confused,\" and then appeared to have a seizure. The patient was obtunded by the time the paramedics arrived. She has a history of psychosis and takes risperidone and diphenhydramine nightly. Temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 179/108 mm Hg, pulse is 135/min and respirations are 24/min. Physical examination shows a young diaphoretic woman who is warm to the touch. Pupils are dilated. There is no nystagmus. Occasional tremors are noted. She is hyperreflexic. Laboratory results are as follows: Serum chemistry Sodium 116 mEq/L Bicarbonate 28 mEq/L Blood urea nitrogen 38 mg/dL Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL Aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 406 U/L Alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) 314 U/L International normalized ratio (INR) 4.5 Creatine kinase, serum 22,656 U/L Which of the following is the most likely ingestion causing this patient's findings?",
"choice_a": "3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine",
"choice_b": "Diphenhydramine",
"choice_c": "Phencyclidine",
"choice_d": "Psilocybin",
"choice_e": "Risperidone",
"correct_answer": "A",
"explanation": "3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy, Molly) is the most common stimulant used in dance clubs and raves. The ingestion of MDMA increases release of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine from presynaptic neurons, preventing their metabolism by inhibiting monoamine oxidase. An oral dose can cause symptoms within 30-60 minutes and last up to 8 hours. Symptoms include euphoria with a sense of profound insight, intimacy, and well-being, but agitation and combativeness can also be present. Adverse effects resulting from sympathetic overload include tachycardia, mydriasis, diaphoresis, tremor, hypertension, arrhythmias, and urinary retention. Serotonin syndrome secondary to MDMA presents with delirium, hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular irritability. It may result in end-organ damage, rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure, hepatic failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and coagulopathy from disseminated intravascular coagulation. Heat from the exertion of dancing in a crowded room coupled with the MDMA-induced hyperthermia can easily lead to excessive water intake and severe hyponatremia. Neurologic effects include confusion, agitation, and seizures due to both MDMA and hyponatremia. Treatment includes supportive care, benzodiazepines (for hypertension, seizures, and agitation), fluids for hyponatremia, and ice baths for hyperthermia. (Choice B) Diphenhydramine overdose usually presents with anticholinergic overdose symptoms such as flushing (red as a beet), very dry skin without diaphoresis (dry as a bone), mydriasis (blind as a bat), agitation (mad as a hatter), and fever (hot as a hare). Sedation can also occur due to antihistaminic effect. MDMA toxicity causes diaphoresis instead of dry skin. (Choice C) Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication may present with bizarre or violent behavior, psychomotor agitation, hallucinations, and incoordination. However, seizures (and rhabdomyolysis) are less common. PCP intoxication often presents with nystagmus (horizontal and vertical), which is not present in this patient. (Choice D) The ingestion of psilocybin (a hallucinogen found in certain mushrooms) can be associated with serotonergic effects. However, physical symptoms are usually mild. Significant sympathetic activation and seizures occur much less commonly with psilocybin. (Choice E) Risperidone overdose would likely cause muscle stiffness and/or oversedation. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which can occur at any antipsychotic dose, is characterized by mental status changes, severe hyperthermia (temperatures sometimes >40 C [104 F]), and generalized lead-pipe rigidity (rather than hyperreflexia). Educational objective: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a stimulant used commonly at parties with overdose presenting as serotonin syndrome, severe hyperthermia, and hyponatremia. MDMA overdose can lead to seizures, coagulopathy, and renal and hepatic failure.",
