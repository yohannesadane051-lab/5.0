    "stem": "A 54-year-old woman who recently received a renal transplant comes to the emergency department due to fevers and malaise for the past 24 hours. She also has had a cough productive of yellow sputum over the past 2 days. No one around her has similar symptoms. Three weeks ago, the patient underwent cadaveric renal transplant for long-standing renal disease. Her immediate postsurgical course was uneventful, and she was extubated 3 days after surgery. Her other medical problems include gastroesophageal reflux, hyperlipidemia, and eczema. After the transplantation, she moved in with her sister, who had just donated her 2 cats to a local pet store. The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol. Her current medications include prednisone, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, valganciclovir, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, pravastatin, and omeprazole. She has no known drug allergies. Her temperature is 38.5 C (101.3 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 18/min. Pulse oximetry shows oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Breath sounds are decreased in the left lung base with mild wheezing over the upper lung fields bilaterally. Her abdomen is soft and nontender without a palpable spleen tip. Neurologic examination is within normal limits. Laboratory results are as follows: Complete blood count Hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL Hematocrit 32% Platelets 187,000/mm3 Leukocytes 15,600/mm3 Serum chemistry Sodium 140 mEq/L Potassium 3.8 mEq/L Chloride 90 mEq/L Blood urea nitrogen 17 mg/dL Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL Calcium 9.1 mg/dL Glucose 96 mg/dL Chest-x ray reveals a left lower lobe infiltrate. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her condition?",
    "choice_a": "Cytomegalovirus",
    "choice_b": "Nocardia asteroides",
    "choice_c": "Pasteurella multocida",
    "choice_d": "Pneumocystis jirovecii",
    "choice_e": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa",
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is concerning for nosocomial pneumonia following recent hospitalization for cadaveric renal transplant. The table summarizes common infections seen in solid organ transplant patients based on the amount of time elapsed following surgery. Within the early posttransplant period (<1 month), patients are at risk for nosocomial infections due to prolonged hospitalization and multiple catheter and device placements/instrumentations. Transplant patients requiring mechanical ventilation are particularly susceptible to nosocomial infections due to gram-positive organisms (eg, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative organisms (eg, Legionella, Pseudomonas), fungi (eg, Candida species), and Clostridium difficile colitis. Pseudomonas commonly colonizes hospital equipment (eg, mechanical ventilation) and is the most likely cause of this patient's pneumonia. (Choice A) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections usually occur between 1-6 months after transplantation and would be unlikely in this patient taking valganciclovir, which is effective for CMV prophylaxis. (Choice B) Opportunistic infection (OI) with Nocardia is rare in the early posttransplant period; it tends to occur >6 months following transplantation, likely reflecting the impact of immunosuppression duration on Ol development. (Choice C) Pasteurella multocida is usually found in the normal respiratory flora of domestic pets (eg. dogs, cats). Human infection (eg, cellulitis, respiratory infections, or bone/joint disease) is typically due to animal bites or scratches. This patient's sister donated her cats, and there is no history of animal bites to suggest Pasteurella infection. (Choice D) Pneumocystis jirovecii usually causes pulmonary complications in transplant patients 3-4 months after surgery. In addition, this patient is on sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for P jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Educational objective: Solid organ transplant patients are more susceptible to nosocomial infections within a month of surgery due to prolonged hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, immunosuppression, and exposure to multiple catheters or devices. Common organisms causing nosocomial pneumonia in transplant patients include vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Candida, and Pseudomonas.",

    "stem": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. She began feeling unwell 6 days ago with fever, throbbing pain behind the eyes, diffuse myalgias, and abdominal pain. Her fever improved 2 days ago, but she noticed an erythematous skin rash developing on her trunk and upper and lower extremities. A few hours prior to admission, the patient had an episode of epistaxis and a syncopal episode when cleaning the bathroom. She has no other medical problems. She returned from a trip to southern Mexico 10 days ago and states that one of her travel companions also has had fevers and myalgias. The patient received the typhoid vaccine before her trip. Her temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 86/60 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 14/min. Examination shows mild abdominal tenderness with no hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the hands is shown below. Laboratory studies are as follows: Hematocrit 52% Platelets 90,000/mm3 Leukocytes 3,300/mm3 Serum sodium 141 mEq/L Serum potassium 4.1 mEq/L Serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL Urinalysis is normal.

    "choice_c": "Leptospirosis",
    "choice_d": "Secondary syphilis",
    "choice_e": "Typhoid fever",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Dengue fever (DF) is a common cause of fever in travelers returning from the Caribbean, parts of Asia, and South America. In addition to fever, the first period of illness (usually 3-5 days) is marked by myalgias, retro-orbital pain/headache, and bleeding complications (eg, epistaxis). As these symptoms improve, a characteristic macular or maculopapular rash (\"islands of white in a sea of red\") may appear. At around the same time, patients enter the critical phase of the illness; some may develop capillary leakage with edema, effusions, hypotension/shock, and severe hemorrhage. A positive tourniquet test may be seen (petechiae following sphygmomanometer inflation for 5 minutes over the arm). Laboratory abnormalities include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated hematocrit due to hemoconcentration (even in the absence of hemorrhage). Diagnosis is made via serology or direct testing for viral components, and care is largely supportive. (Choice B) Epstein-Barr virus can cause infectious mononucleosis, which typically presents with pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and lymphocytosis. (Choice C) Leptospirosis may present similarly to DF. However, patients usually have conjunctival suffusion, pulmonary involvement (eg, cough, dyspnea), and/or renal involvement (eg. proteinuria, electrolyte abnormalities). (Choice D) Secondary syphilis can present with systemic symptoms and a diffuse maculopapular rash involving the palms and soles. However, it is not usually associated with bleeding diathesis, hypotension, or thrombocytopenia. (Choice E) Typhoid fever typically presents with weeks of sequential fever followed by rose spots (faint salmon-colored macules on trunk and abdomen) and abdominal pain; some cases may progress to hepatosplenomegaly, bleeding, and shock. This patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with DF. In addition, she received the typhoid vaccine before the trip. Educational objective: Dengue fever is a common cause of fever in travelers returning from an endemic area (eg, Caribbean, parts of Asia, and South America). Patients typically develop fever, retro-orbital pain/headache, a characteristic macular rash, and bleeding complications. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory abnormalities.",

    "stem": "A 45-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband due to fever and confusion. He notes that the patient began having fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting yesterday. She was also disoriented and made many odd statements to her children. The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease and underwent simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation 2 years ago. She takes maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. Temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 21/min. The patient is lethargic and ill-appearing. No skin rash is present. The lungs are clear to auscultation, and there are no heart murmurs. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The patient is oriented only to self and moves all extremities to pain. No nuchal rigidity or signs of meningismus are elicited. Leukocyte count is 15,500/mm3, serum creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL, and plasma glucose is 90 mg/dL Blood cultures are obtained, and empiric antibiotics are administered. CT scan of the head shows no hemorrhage or mass, and lumbar puncture is subsequently performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results are as follows: Glucose 30 mg/dL Protein 120 mg/dL Leukocytes 1,000/mm3 with 80% neutrophils CSF Gram stain reveals numerous gram-positive bacilli. Which of the following is the best treatment?",
    "choice_a": "Ampicillin only",
    "choice_b": "Cefepime only",
    "choice_c": "Vancomycin and ampicillin",
    "choice_d": "Vancomycin and cefepime",
    "choice_e": "Vancomycin only",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient with fever, headache, and altered mental status has 3 of the 4 classic manifestations of acute bacterial meningitis. All 4 manifestations (including neck stiffness) are present in <45% of cases. Priorities of care include the pursuit of a microbial diagnosis by blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stain/culture and prompt initiation of empiric antimicrobial treatment to limit risk of neurologic sequelae and death. CSF Gram stain has a sensitivity of 60%-90% and a specificity of >97% when lumbar puncture is performed prior to antibiotic therapy. Patients who receive antibiotics prior to lumbar puncture may have lower yields. Positive Gram stain (or culture) should prompt the transition from empiric to targeted antibiotic therapy. This patient has gram-positive bacilli in the CSF, indicating likely Listeria monocytogenes meningoencephalitis, which most commonly affects neonates, adults age >50, and those with immunocompromise (eg, immunosuppressive treatment). Empiric therapy should now be narrowed to intravenous ampicillin or penicillin G. An aminoglycoside is sometimes added for synergy. (Choice B) Cefepime monotherapy is primarily used to treat bacterial meningitis when CSF Gram stain shows gram-negative (not gram-positive) bacilli, and patients are at risk for resistant organisms (eg, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter) due to immunocompromise, a neurosurgical device, or recent neurosurgery or head trauma. (Choices C, D, and E) Vancomycin is primarily used in the treatment of bacterial meningitis to cover for cephalosporin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (gram-positive cocci) or when Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococcus is likely (eg, recent head trauma, neurosurgery, neurosurgical device). It is also used in combination with cefepime and ampicillin to empirically treat bacterial meningitis when patients are immunocompromised. Listeria is almost universally sensitive to ampicillin and penicillin G; vancomycin is not required at this time. Educational objective: Patients with suspected bacterial meningitis who have a positive cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain should have empiric therapy narrowed to target the likely organism. Patients with gram-positive bacilli are likely to have Listeria monocytogenes meningoencephalitis; first-line treatment consists of ampicillin or penicillin G with or without a synergistic aminoglycoside.",

    "stem": "A 28-year-old woman with fever and lethargy is brought to the emergency department accompanied by her roommate. The roommate reports that the patient appeared well last night but awoke this morning confused. Throughout the morning she became increasingly confused and eventually unarousable, prompting her roommate to call an ambulance. Her past medical history is significant for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. There is no history of recent travel. Her temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 84/42 mm Hg, pulse is 122/min, and respirations are 28/min. Oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Physical examination shows an ill-appearing woman. Pupils are equal and round but sluggish. Lungs have patchy rales. Abdominal examination reveals a surgical scar in the left upper quadrant. There are diffuse ecchymotic areas throughout the torso and lower extremities, with areas of bullae and vesicle formation. There is no rash on the palms or soles. There are no meningeal signs. Laboratory results as follows: Complete blood count Hemoglobin 16.2 g/dL Hematocrit 54% Platelets 40,000/μL Leukocytes 19,800/μL Neutrophils 58% Band forms 32% Lymphocytes 7% Monocytes 2% Serum chemistry Sodium 126 mEq/L Potassium 3.8 mEq/L Chloride 94 mEq/L Bicarbonate 11 mEq/L Blood urea nitrogen 62 mg/dL Creatinine 2.9 mg/dL Serum creatine kinase 7990 U/L Chest x-ray reveals bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Which of the following antibiotics would be most effective at targeting the suspected pathogen?",
    "choice_a": "Ampicillin",
    "choice_b": "Ceftriaxone",
    "choice_c": "Clindamycin",
    "choice_d": "Doxycycline",
    "choice_e": "Vancomycin",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient has fever, hypotension, altered mental status, and rash (very likely purpura fulminans). She likely has a history of splenectomy (left upper quadrant surgical scar), which increases her risk for an encapsulated organism (eg, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae). Her presentation and rapid deterioration with severe sepsis and DIC make meningococcemia from N meningitidis the most likely diagnosis. N meningitidis is the second most common cause of adult bacterial meningitis in the world and is transmitted via the respiratory route through pharyngeal secretions. Patients may present with fever, severe myalgias (often misdiagnosed early as viral influenza), or severe sepsis without focal signs of meningitis (summarized in the table). Nearly 25% of patients may present with purpura fulminans due to circulating bacterial endotoxin causing cutaneous hemorrhage, progressive skin and soft-tissue necrosis, and subsequent DIC. Early empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, aggressive fluids, oxygen, and vasopressor support should be initiated immediately. Third-generation cephalosporins (eg. ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) are the most appropriate therapy for N meningitidis, but vancomycin is also added to cover for possible pneumococcal infection until final culture results are available. (Choice A) Ampicillin is effective for suspected Listeria meningitis, which is seen more commonly in neonates, adults age 50, and immunocompromised patients. (Choice C) Clindamycin is used to treat streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which usually presents with extremity or soft-tissue pain followed by ecchymoses, skin sloughing, and necrotizing myositis/fascitis. Although TSS can present with fever and altered mental status, it does not usually have the petechial rash seen in this patient. Clindamycin also does not have activity against Neisseria species. (Choice D) Doxycycline is used to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever, in which rash usually does not appear until the third to fifth day after onset of fever. The rash starts around the ankles and wrists, involves the palms and soles, and is usually petechial. This patient's rash started abruptly along with the fever, has evolved into bullae, and is not present on the palms and soles. (Choice E) Vancomycin is added to a third-generation cephalosporin for the treatment of bacterial meningitis to include coverage for possible penicillin-resistant pneumococcus. However, it is not effective against N meningitidis and should not be used as monotherapy. Educational objective: Patients with history of splenectomy are susceptible to severe infections from encapsulated bacteria (eg, N meningitidis). Meningococcemia may present with fever, myalgias, purpura fulminans, meningitis, DIC, and shock (with or without adrenal insufficiency). Treatment includes third-generation cephalosporins (eg. ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) and vancomycin. Close respiratory contacts of affected individuals require prophylaxis with rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone.",

Which of the following individuals needs antibiotics for post-exposure prophylaxis?",
    "choice_a": "Medical resident who performed the initial lumbar puncture",
    "choice_b": "Emergency department nurse who triaged the patient",
    "choice_c": "Patient's boyfriend, who received the meningococcal vaccine 1 year ago",
    "choice_d": "Transporter who took the patient from the emergency department to the intensive care unit",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation of fever, rash, decreased level of consciousness and Gram-negative diplococci on lumbar puncture suggests likely meningococcal infection from Neisseria meningitidis. Meningococcus usually spreads through droplets of respiratory secretions and can transmit rapidly to contacts within close proximity (3-6 feet). Individuals require antibiotic prophylaxis if they have close contact and prolonged duration (8 hours) regardless of vaccination status. Healthcare workers (with close proximity and prolonged duration or exposure to respiratory secretions) and close contacts of infected patients with meningococcal disease ideally should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis within the first 24 hours of the patient's diagnosis. Exposure usually occurs during the week prior to onset of symptoms or 24 hours prior to antimicrobial therapy. Recommended regimens include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone. This patient's boyfriend would warrant antimicrobial therapy. (Choices A, B, and D) The nurse, medical resident, and transporter would need antibiotic prophylaxis only if they were exposed to respiratory secretions or were in very close proximity to the secretions for a prolonged period. These workers had a relatively short duration of exposure and would benefit less from antibiotic prophylaxis. If this patient required intubation, the physician who performed it would require antimicrobial prophylaxis. Educational objective: Regardless of vaccination status, healthcare workers (with close proximity and prolonged duration or exposure to respiratory secretions) and close contacts of infected patients with meningococcal disease should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis, ideally within the first 24 hours of patient diagnosis. Recommended regimens include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone.",

She has had no double vision, limb weakness, numbness, difficulty swallowing, or recent head trauma, but she does note some malaise and mild neck stiffness. The patient has a history of migraines but says her current headaches are different in quality and more persistent. She has seasonal allergies and takes over-the-counter antihistamines as needed.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient who currently resides in Connecticut has evidence of facial nerve palsy (unilateral facial weakness, impaired corneal reflex) and likely meningitis (headache, photophobia, nuchal rigidity), raising suspicion for early disseminated Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness endemic to the northeastern United States. Manifestations typically arise in 3 progressive clinical stages: Early localized disease - A few weeks of viral-like symptoms and a spreading, annular rash (erythema migrans). Early disseminated disease - Several weeks or months later, patients can develop acute arthralgias, carditis (eg, atrioventricular block), and neurologic disease (eg, facial nerve palsy, meningitis). Late Lyme disease - Late symptoms usually occur months or years after the initial inoculation. The most common manifestation is intermittent or persistent arthritis in ≥1 large joints (particularly the knee). More serious neurologic disease such as Lyme encephalopathy can also occur. Although Lyme disease usually progresses in a stepwise fashion, there can occasionally be manifestations of multiple stages at the same time. Patients can also have symptoms of early disseminated or late Lyme disease without having manifestations of previous stages. (Choice B) Lyme carditis generally occurs within a few months of infection and is considered a manifestation of early disseminated Lyme disease. The most common finding is atrioventricular conduction block, but patients can also occasionally develop myopericarditis. Chronic dilated cardiomyopathy is rare. (Choice C) Lower extremity paraplegia and meningitis can be seen with tuberculosis infections of the central nervous system. Although this patient did travel to a TB-endemic country (India), central nervous system tuberculosis is much less common than Lyme disease and rarely causes facial nerve palsy. (Choice D) Seizures are more common with encephalitis (eg, herpes encephalitis) than with meningitis. Lyme disease is not typically associated with an increased risk of seizures. (Choice E) Conjunctivitis is seen in approximately 10% of cases of early disseminated Lyme disease. Other ocular manifestations are rare. Late Lyme disease is most likely to cause arthritis, not vision loss. Educational objective: The manifestations of Lyme disease are typically categorized into 3 progressive stages. Early localized infection is marked by a viral-like syndrome and erythema migrans. Weeks or months later, patients can develop signs of early disseminated disease such as arthralgias, carditis (eg, atrioventricular block), and nervous system abnormalities (eg, facial nerve palsy, meningitis). Late Lyme disease is typically associated with intermittent or persistent arthritis in ≥1 large joints (particularly the knee).",

The symptoms largely resolved 2 days ago, but this morning the patient began having productive cough of green-yellow sputum, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. He has had no recent travel or other significant illness. The patient has not received the influenza vaccine. He has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.

    "choice_d": "Azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin",
    "choice_e": "Supportive care only",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This young patient had influenza symptoms, transiently improved, and then developed worsened fever and lower respiratory manifestations (productive cough, pleurisy, dyspnea), raising strong suspicion for influenza complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading pathogens; Haemophilus influenzae is sometimes isolated. Most cases occur in patients age >65 or those with certain underlying conditions. Young, previously healthy patients can also be affected; these cases are often linked to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The empiric treatment of post-influenza pneumonia should include: Typical community-acquired pneumonia coverage (eg, ceftriaxone and azithromycin) MRSA coverage (eg, vancomycin) Antiviral treatment (eg, oseltamivir) - patients who develop influenza complications such as secondary pneumonia are typically treated with antivirals even if they present >48 hours after influenza symptom onset. (Choice A) Primary tuberculosis typically presents with the gradual onset of fever and pleuritic chest pain, sometimes with fatigue, cough, or arthralgias. Chest x-ray usually shows hilar adenopathy without the dense consolidation seen in this patient. (Choice B) Community-acquired MRSA is a common cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia following influenza infection and must be covered empirically with vancomycin. If cultures or Gram stain reveal that MRSA is unlikely, vancomycin can be discontinued. (Choice C) Piperacillin/tazobactam is typically added for anti-pseudomonal coverage in hospital-acquired pneumonia. This patient has no risk factors for pseudomonal pneumonia (eg, prior hospitalization, immunocompromised status, cirrhosis, recent antibiotic or glucocorticoid use) and should receive vancomycin plus community-acquired pneumonia treatment. (Choice E) Patients with uncomplicated influenza who have had >48 hours of symptoms are generally managed with supportive care. Supportive care would be insufficient for this patient with pneumonia (fever, productive cough, leukocytosis, pulmonary infiltrate). Educational objective: Secondary bacterial pneumonia is typically characterized by a transient improvement of influenza symptoms followed by worsened fever and lower respiratory tract illness. Most cases are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is also a frequent culprit, particularly in young, previously healthy patients. Empiric treatment should include coverage for community-acquired pneumonia (eg, ceftriaxone and azithromycin) and for MRSA (eg, vancomycin).",

    "choice_c": "Cryptosporidiosis",
    "choice_d": "Cytomegalovirus",
    "choice_e": "Hepatitis B virus",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical presentation suggests atypical mycobacterial infection such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). MAC organisms (M avium or M intracellulare) are ubiquitous in the environment. Infection occurs via inhalation or ingestion before disseminating through lymphatics to cause bacteremia. The risk of conversion from colonization to MAC bacteremia in a patient with AIDS and a CD4+ of < 50 cells/µl is estimated to be 60% within 1 year. Prophylaxis includes weekly azithromycin or daily clarithromycin/rifabutin, which is continued until 3 months after CD4 > 100 cells/mm3. Localized MAC infection occurs in immunocompetent individuals or HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) as part of immune reconstitution. Patients may present with fever, leukocytosis, and focal lymphadenitis (cervical, intra-abdominal, mediastinal). Blood cultures are usually negative and diagnosis is confirmed with culture from lymph node aspirate. Disseminated MAC usually presents with fever, night sweats, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss (wasting syndrome). Laboratory findings include anemia, pancytopenia (if bone marrow is involved), and elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Diagnosis is confirmed by blood cultures, which may take up to 3 weeks to become positive. Bone marrow biopsy with acid-fast bacilli staining is more invasive but can isolate the mycobacteria. Computed tomography scans are nonspecific and can be normal or reveal lymphadenopathy, small bowel thickening, or hepatosplenomegaly. Treatment involves clarithromycin (preferred over azithromycin) and ethambutol. Rifabutin is added for patients with high mycobacterial loads (> 2 log colony-forming units/mL of blood) or ineffective ART. Patients already taking ART can continue the retroviral medications. Patients not taking ART usually start after 2 weeks of MAC treatment to decrease the chance of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. (Choice B) Crohn's disease can present with prolonged diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss. However, this patient's hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and low CD4 count are more suggestive of disseminated MAC infection. (Choice C) Cryptosporidiosis in HIV patients usually presents with secretory diarrhea, systemic symptoms and impaired vitamin B12 absorption. Biliary tract disease occurs in 10%-30% of HIV patients and presents with acalculous cholecystitis, sclerosing cholangitis, and pancreatitis. However, hepatosplenomegaly and abdominal lymphadenopathy are uncommon. (Choice D) Cytomegalovirus infection in HIV patients usually results in retinitis, painful esophagitis, and colitis. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in HIV patients usually indicate MAC infection, histoplasmosis, or lymphoma, but not cytomegalovirus infection. (Choice E) Acute hepatitis B viral infection typically presents with fever, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant discomfort, and arthralgias with or without jaundice. Serum aminotransferase (ALT > AST) levels are usually > 1000 IU/L in the acute phase. Educational objective: Mycobacterium avium complex infection occurs in HIV-infected patients with CD4 < 50 cells/mm3. Disseminated disease presents with fever, night sweats, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Hepatosplenomegaly and abdominal lymphadenopathy are common.

    "explanation": "This patient who recently visited Connecticut developed influenza-like symptoms and erythema migrans (rash with central clearing) raising strong suspicion for early localized Lyme disease. However, the presence of high fever and cytopenias is atypical for Lyme disease and suggests coinfection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). Both Lyme disease and HGA are transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick, and coinfection occurs in approximately 2%-15% of cases. HGA is characterized by influenza-like symptoms, high fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated aminotransferases. Rash is fairly uncommon and usually suggests coinfection with Lyme disease (erythema migrans) or a rickettsial organism. Diagnosis is made by serology (sensitive but must be measured during the acute and convalescent phases) or buffy coat or peripheral blood smear examination for characteristic intraleukocytic morulae (less sensitive but rapid). Empiric treatment with doxycycline should be initiated to prevent complications such as seizures, coma, and respiratory/renal failure. The I scapularis tick is also the vector for babesiosis, which is typically characterized by anemia (hemolytic) and thrombocytopenia and most commonly occurs in patients with a history of splenectomy. (Choice A) Parvovirus can cause flu-like symptoms, arthralgias, and/or erythema infectiosum, which is associated with a \"slapped cheek\" malar rash. Anemia is often a primary feature; leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occur less commonly. (Choice B) Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) serology is typically negative for the first several days of infection and is unhelpful in medical decision-making (as treatment with doxycycline should be initiated ≤5 days after symptom onset). In addition, the RMSF rash is typically petechial, starts on the ankles and wrists, and spreads centripetally (and to the palms and soles). (Choice C) Although this patient has leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, the presence of concurrent flulike symptoms, high fever, and erythema migrans likely indicates a tick-borne illness. Bone marrow biopsy is not needed at this time. (Choice D) This patient's erythema migrans and flulike symptoms suggest early localized Lyme disease; serology is most often negative at this stage and is not recommended (as early localized Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis). Educational objective: Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), a tick-borne illness, should be suspected in patients from endemic areas who develop flulike symptoms with leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Coinfection with Lyme disease occurs in up to 15% of cases (both are transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick) and should be suspected when patients also have a rash with central clearing. Diagnosis can be made with buffy coat or peripheral blood smear examination (intraleukocytic morulae); empiric treatment with doxycycline should be initiated while awaiting testing results.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient is from a Lyme disease-endemic area and had a transient thigh rash 4 weeks earlier, suggesting Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Patients typically present with initial erythema migrans and nonspecific flu-like symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue, headache, and body aches). As the disease disseminates in the following weeks to months, patients may present with acute neurologic and/or cardiac symptoms as the first clinical sign of the disease. Lyme carditis, as in this patient, may be asymptomatic or present with palpitations (most common), lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea, or chest pain. Palpitations can be a nonspecific finding and may not represent true underlying heart disease. Lyme carditis most commonly presents (objectively) with atrioventricular (AV) conduction blocks that sometimes fluctuate between first- and second-degree block. Progression to complete heart block is possible, and the risk is increased with PR interval > 300 msec. Lyme myopericarditis is usually self-limited and sometimes causes mild pericardial effusion but rarely causes cardiomegaly (Choices C and D). Although cardiomyopathy has been reported in Europe, there have been no such cases reported in the United States. Atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias occur less commonly in Lyme carditis (Choices A and E). Diagnosis is confirmed by clinical features and positive ELISA and western blot Lyme serologies. Current guidelines recommend hospital admission with IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone preferred) to prevent long-term complications in symptomatic patients and those with second- or third-degree AV block or first-degree AV block with PR interval > 300 msec. Oral antibiotics (eg, doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime) should be continued at discharge for a 21- to 28-day total course. Complete AV block requires temporary pacing as these blocks are self-limited and usually improve within 1 week. Lesser conduction disturbances may take up to 6 weeks for resolution. Educational objective: Lyme carditis can be asymptomatic or present with palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea, or chest pain. Atrioventricular conduction block is the most common cardiac presentation and can progress to complete heart block. Hospital admission with IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone preferred) is recommended for symptomatic patients and those with second- or third-degree AV block or first-degree AV block with PR interval > 300 msec.",

Echocardiography is recommended for all patients with S aureus bacteremia due to the high risk of associated metastatic complications. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) should be performed first, although a transesophageal echocardiogram is more sensitive in detecting valve vegetations and could be considered if there is no evidence of vegetations on TTE. (Choices A and B) The routine addition of gentamicin or rifampin is not recommended in cases of MRSA bacteremia. Gentamicin is sometimes added to shorter courses of penicillin therapy for selected patients with native-valve endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible strains. Some guidelines recommend adding rifampin to vancomycin in patients with a penicillin allergy who are being treated for methicillin-susceptible native-valve endocarditis. (Choice C) Colonoscopy is recommended in cases of bacteremia caused by Streptococcus gallolyticus due to a strong association with colonic malignancy. There is no association between MRSA bacteremia and colonic lesions. (Choice E) Although metastatic complications to the eye can occur with MRSA bacteremia, they are uncommon, and ophthalmologic evaluation in a patient without visual symptoms is generally not recommended. In contrast, all patients with candidemia should undergo ophthalmologic evaluation.

    "explanation": "This patient with ovarian cancer who recently received chemotherapy has febrile neutropenia, which is generally defined as a temperature >38.3 C (>101 F) and an absolute neutrophil count <500/mm. Most cases are due to gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (most common), Staphylococcus aureus, and streptococci, but gram-negative bacteria (eg, Pseudomonas) are isolated in approximately 25% of cases and are often associated with more severe illness. Monotherapy with an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (eg, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime) or a carbapenem is considered first-line treatment in the inpatient setting. Studies have shown no improvement in mortality with the routine addition of a second agent (eg, vancomycin) targeting gram-positive pathogens (Choice A). Indications for vancomycin include: Hemodynamic instability; Severe sepsis; Pneumonia; Positive blood cultures for a gram-positive organism (prior to speciation results); Suspected catheter-related infection (eg, chills during infusion, cellulitis around entry site); Skin or soft-tissue infection. (Choice B) Ceftazidime plus ciprofloxacin are sometimes used in combination to double cover potential Pseudomonas infections. However, Pseudomonas double coverage is controversial and typically reserved for those who are severely ill (eg, patients with sepsis/septic shock, burn patients with severe infection) and at high risk for multidrug-resistant infections. Ceftazidime monotherapy should be avoided in neutropenic fever due to rising resistance in gram-negative bacteria and limited activity against gram-positive organisms (eg, viridans streptococci). Adding ciprofloxacin may improve gram-negative coverage but would not provide better gram-positive coverage. (Choice D) Empiric antifungal treatment for febrile neutropenia is generally reserved for patients who have been febrile >4-7 days, those who are undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia, or those who have recently undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. (Choice E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be used to treat urinary tract and skin/soft-tissue infections but is not a mainstay antibiotic for febrile neutropenia. Low-risk febrile neutropenia can be treated with oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Educational objective: Hospitalized patients with neutropenic fever should generally receive monotherapy with an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (eg, piperacillin-tazobactam) or a carbapenem. The routine addition of a second agent (eg, vancomycin) targeting gram-positive pathogens is not recommended.",

    "explanation": "This patient who recently traveled to Bangladesh likely has measles. Measles is rare in the United States due to widespread vaccination efforts, but sporadic cases and outbreaks have been linked to travelers returning from endemic regions. Most cases arise in unvaccinated individuals as a single dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 93% protective and 2 doses (full vaccination) are 97% protective. However, vaccinated individuals can rarely develop the disease due to vaccine failure or waned immunity. Patients with measles infection usually pass through the following stages: Prodrome: Fever, malaise, and anorexia followed by the \"3 Cs\" of cough, conjunctivitis, and coryza. Koplik spots, small white-grey-blue lesions on an erythematous base, frequently form on the buccal and/or labial mucosa. Exanthem: Begins 2-4 days after fever onset and is characterized by an erythematous, macular, blanching rash that usually starts on the face and spreads in a cephalocaudal and centrifugal manner. Recovery: Clinical improvement usually begins within 48 hours of rash onset. However, complications, including diarrhea, immunosuppression with severe secondary infection, pneumonia, and/or neurologic disease (eg, encephalitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), arise in up to 30% of cases. Patients with suspected measles infections require serum and throat/nasopharyngeal swab testing for measles IgM or RT-PCR. Treatment is largely supportive as no antiviral therapy is currently available. Measles is transmitted by droplet nuclei (which can remain suspended in the air for up to 2 hours) so airborne isolation is required for at least 4 days after rash onset; close contacts should be advised to wear masks or respirators. (Choice B) Cerebrospinal fluid analysis would be indicated for potential meningococcal infection, which typically presents within 24 hours (not 4 days) of symptom onset with fever, malaise, myalgias, headache, meningeal signs, and/or hemodynamic instability. Rash can occur but is typically petechial (nonblanching). (Choice C) Mononucleosis can cause fever, malaise, and maculopapular rash (usually after the administration of amoxicillin). However, most cases are also marked by tonsillitis/pharyngitis and cervical lymphadenopathy. Coryza, conjunctivitis, and white buccal lesions make measles more likely. (Choice D) Malaria often causes paroxysmal fever, nonspecific symptoms, and splenomegaly. Conjunctivitis, coryza, Koplik spots, and a maculopapular rash are not typical features. (Choice E) Doxycycline can be used to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a tickborne illness that initially causes fever and nonspecific symptoms. Rash typically forms on day 3-5 and is blanching and erythematous, becomes petechial over time, and moves in a centripetal direction (starts on the wrists and ankles and moves centrally). This patient with a central rash and Koplik spots is more likely to have measles. Educational objective: Measles infections tend to begin with fever, malaise, and anorexia followed by the \"3 Cs\" of cough, conjunctivitis, and coryza. Koplik spots (white lesions on an erythematous base) then form on mucous membranes, followed by the characteristic exanthem (maculopapular rash that spreads in a cephalocaudal and centrifugal manner). Measles is highly infectious and transmitted by droplet nuclei, so airborne isolation is required for at least 4 days after rash onset.",

    "explanation": "This patient's high fever, headache, and extremity rash raise suspicion for Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). RMSF is a potentially lethal tick-borne illness due to Rickettsia rickettsii. Although RMSF can occur throughout the United States, it is most common in the southeastern region. Peak incidence is in the spring and summer. Manifestations usually begin with nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, severe headache, malaise, myalgias, arthralgias) followed 3-5 days later by a maculopapular rash that becomes petechial over time. The rash typically starts on the ankles and wrists and spreads centrally to the trunk and peripherally to the palms and soles. Hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum transaminases are important diagnostic clues. Identifying potential cases of RMSF is often challenging because approximately 35% of patients have no knowledge of tick bite and only 15% of patients have a rash at presentation. A minority (~10%) never develop a rash (\"spotless\" RMSF). Because of these difficulties, empiric first-line treatment with doxycycline is typically administered to patients who develop a nonspecific febrile illness in the spring and summer if they are from an endemic area and have had known or possible tick exposure. Early treatment is crucial as antibiotic initiation ≥5 days after symptom onset is associated with much higher risk of morbidity (eg, encephalitis, gangrene of the digits) and death. The diagnosis is usually confirmed several days later with serology or skin biopsy (after the rash appears). (Choice B) Meningococcemia can also cause headache, fever, and a petechial rash, but most cases come to clinical attention <24 hours after symptom onset and are also associated with confusion and meningeal signs (eg, nuchal rigidity). If early meningococcemia cannot be differentiated from RMSF, patients sometimes require a combination of empiric ceftriaxone and doxycycline while awaiting cerebrospinal fluid results. (Choice C) Mononucleosis can cause high fever and a rash (usually after antibiotic administration), but patients also typically have sore throat, lymphadenopathy, malaise, and/or splenomegaly. (Choice D) Secondary syphilis can also cause a maculopapular rash that involves the palms and soles but is not usually associated with high fevers. Patients who may have secondary syphilis but are at risk for RMSF should be treated with doxycycline while syphilis serology is pending. (Choice E) Infective endocarditis can cause high fever and skin manifestations (eg, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes), but a maculopapular rash on the bilateral extremities would be atypical. Educational objective: Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne rickettsial illness that causes nonspecific symptoms followed by a maculopapular rash 3-5 days later. The rash typically starts on the ankles and wrists and spreads centrally to the trunk and peripherally to the palms and soles. Empiric therapy with doxycycline should be started as soon as possible to decrease morbidity and mortality.",

    "explanation": "This Hispanic immigrant likely has neurocysticercosis, an important cause of seizure in individuals from endemic areas (eg, Central and South America). Neurocysticercosis occurs from ingestion of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) eggs shed in the stool of human tapeworm carriers. Over a period of weeks, cysts can develop in the brain parenchyma (most common), intraventricular or subarachnoid space, spine, and/or eyes. After the asymptomatic viable phase (~3-5 years), cysts degenerate and can no longer evade host defenses. Inflammation causes neurologic symptoms depending on the site and extent of brain involvement. Parenchymal brain disease typically presents with seizure and headache. Neuroimaging (eg, CT or MRI) may demonstrate multiple stages of cysts concurrently, which tend to lodge in the cerebral cortex or brainstem. Viable cysts appear as 5-20 mm round, hypodense lesions without contrast enhancement. Inflammation and edema may be apparent as the cysts degenerate, and eventually, calcified granulomas may form. Treatment generally includes antiparasitics (eg, albendazole) and/or corticosteroids. (Choice B) Glioblastoma multiforme usually appears as a large solitary tumor within the cerebral hemisphere with irregular-enhancing margins and a central necrotic core. The tumor also tends to spread across white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum (eg, butterfly glioma). (Choice C) Non-seminomatous germ cell tumors rarely metastasize to the brain, but when present, these typically appear as multiple lesions at the junction of gray and white matter, usually with significant surrounding edema. (Choice D) Cerebral toxoplasmosis is rare in immunocompetent hosts. However, in HIV-infected patients, it can cause encephalitis (eg, headache, confusion, fever) and appear as multiple ring-enhancing lesions on neuroimaging. (Choice E) Central nervous system tuberculosis usually presents with a subacute febrile illness followed by meningismus, focal deficits, confusion, and seizure. Neuroimaging may reveal basilar meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, and tuberculomas (iso- or hyperdense encapsulated lesions with ring enhancement). The absence of systemic symptoms or characteristic neuroimaging makes the diagnosis less likely in this patient. Educational objective: Neurocysticercosis is an important cause of seizure in individuals from endemic areas (eg, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa), including Hispanic immigrants. Neuroimaging (eg, CT or MRI) may reveal viable cysts (5-20 mm round, hypodense lesions without enhancement), enhancement/edema as cysts degenerate, and calcified granulomas in the cortex or brainstem.",

Chest x-ray reveals patchy alveolar opacities in the right upper lobe and a 3-cm abscess in the right middle lobe. Head CT scan shows an abscess in the right cerebral hemisphere. A transesophageal echocardiogram reveals no vegetations. Which of the following conditions is most consistent with this patient's clinical presentation?",
    "choice_a": "Actinomycosis",
    "choice_b": "Atypical mycobacteria infection",
    "choice_c": "Nocardiosis",
    "choice_d": "Bacterial endocarditis",
    "choice_e": "Toxoplasmosis",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient with lung and CNS disease after organ transplantation has likely nocardiosis. Nocardia is found in the soil and can enter the body through inhalation or direct contact with soil. Because it is not part of normal human flora, isolation of the organism from any bodily fluids (eg, sputum) is considered an infection. Patients usually present with lung (primary site) infection. Nocardia has special tropism to neural tissue, and usually manifests as brain abscess. Immunocompromised patients presenting with pulmonary nocardiosis should therefore undergo brain imaging to rule out abscess. Diagnosis of nocardiosis is made clinically with symptoms and partially acid-fast, branching rods isolated in specimens. Aerobic cultures for Nocardia can take 5-20 days for growth. PCR testing for Nocardia is more rapid and accurate but is not widely available. Nonsevere cutaneous nocardiosis can be treated with oral antibiotics (eg, TMP-SMX); systemic disease requires IV antibiotics. Patients usually require antibiotics for prolonged periods due to the relapsing nature of the infection. Immunocompromised patients may require lifelong suppressive therapy with TMP-SMX or doxycycline. (Choice A) In contrast to Nocardia, Actinomyces is an anaerobic Gram-positive rod that is part of normal oral flora and contains sulfur granules. Actinomyces most commonly affects the face (usually after dental work/infections or oromaxillary trauma) and abdominal organs. CNS and pulmonary actinomycosis are less common. (Choice B) Atypical mycobacterial infections usually present with chronic pulmonary symptoms or soft-tissue infections but rarely become disseminated or involve the CNS. (Choice D) This patient's absence of known predisposing factors and vegetations on TEE makes endocarditis less likely. (Choice E) Toxoplasma gondii most commonly affects the CNS (95%) and rarely affects the lungs. Most infections occur due to reactivation of latent infection. CT usually shows multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions with surrounding edema, most commonly in the basal ganglia. Educational objective: Nocardia is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients and typically involves the lung, brain, and skin. Diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed with culture isolating acid-fast, filamentous Gram-positive rods. Treatment involves TMP-SMX, imipenem, amikacin, or third-generation cephalosporins.",

He was treated with acetaminophen at the nursing home, but was found to be very confused this morning. His oral intake has also been poor. His daily medications include lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and tiotropium. He has never been hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation or pneumonia. At the nursing home, there have been two cases of mild febrile illness over the past two weeks. In the emergency department, he is ill-appearing and obtunded. His temperature is 39.4 C (103 F), blood pressure is 107/60 mm Hg, pulse is 68/min and respirations are 26/min. Pulmonary examination reveals crackles at the left lung base. Bowel sounds are hyperactive and his abdomen is soft. There are no meningeal signs present.

Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin are started empirically. Over the next 48 hours, his clinical status continues to deteriorate. A repeat chest x ray reveals progressive infiltrates with worsening left lower lobe consolidation. This patient's condition is most likely to respond to which of the following?",
    "choice_a": "Ampicillin",
    "choice_b": "Levofloxacin",
    "choice_c": "Linezolid",
    "choice_d": "Metronidazole",
    "choice_e": "Oseltamivir",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's underlying risk factors (elderly age, COPD, nursing home resident), clinical presentation (confusion, high fever with bradycardia), laboratory abnormalities (hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, elevated LFTs), and failure to respond to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam are strongly suggestive of Legionella pneumonia. Legionella species are facultative intracellular gram-negative bacilli whose natural habitats are aquatic bodies (e.g., lakes, streams, man-made reservoirs, standing water). There are no pathognomonic or highly specific clinical, laboratory, or radiological features for Legionella infection. The most common x-ray finding is a unilobar infiltrate that progresses to consolidation. Patients with suspected Legionella pneumonia should have both a urinary Legionella antigen test (detects only L. pneumophila, serogroup 1) and a respiratory sample (e.g., sputum, BAL) for Legionella culture. Suspected or proven Legionella pneumonia requires treatment with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g.. levofloxacin) or \"newer\" macrolide (e.g., azithromycin), as both have good lung penetration with potent intracellular activity. (Choice A) Ampicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam are both beta-lactam antibiotics and are ineffective against Legionella. Ampicillin is commonly used to treat Listeria, which causes meningitis/sepsis but not pneumonia. (Choice C) Linezolid is approved for treating MRSA pneumonia and is as effective as vancomycin. However, vancomycin and linezolid are not effective against Legionella. (Choice D) Metronidazole is effective for anaerobic aspiration pneumonia but not for Legionella. (Choice E) Oseltamivir treats primary influenza pneumonia, which more commonly shows bilateral reticular or reticulonodular opacities. Educational objective: Legionella pneumonia usually presents with fever, relative bradycardia, possible neurologic and GI symptoms, and potential unilobar chest x-ray infiltrate progressing to consolidation. Suspected patients with Legionella pneumonia should have both a urinary antigen test and a Legionella culture from a respiratory sample to confirm diagnosis. Treatment consists of respiratory fluoroquinolones (e.g.. levofloxacin) or \"newer\" macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) while awaiting results.",

    "choice_c": "Sarcoidosis",
    "choice_d": "Tuberculosis",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation of cough, fever, arthralgia, and erythema nodosum after recent travel to the southwestern United States is consistent with coccidioidomycosis. In immunocompetent hosts, Coccidioides immitis may be asymptomatic or cause only a minor febrile respiratory syndrome (\"valley fever\"). However, in immunocompromised patients, C immitis can also cause acute pneumonia (most common), chronic progressive pneumonia, nodular or cavitary lung disease, extrapulmonary disease, or meningitis. Patients receiving tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, such as infliximab, are at increased risk for opportunistic fungal infections. Diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is primarily based on epidemiologic (ie, travel) history and clinical findings, and is confirmed with culture, microscopy (potassium hydroxide preparation), or serology. Most patients with valley fever improve without therapy; however, fluconazole or itraconazole should be considered for those with evidence of severe infection or immunosuppression. (Choice B) Hodgkin lymphoma most commonly presents with painless cervical adenopathy. Systemic symptoms may develop as the disorder progresses and adenopathy develops in contiguous areas (eg, mediastinum). This patient does not have lymphadenopathy. (Choice C) Sarcoidosis may present similarly to coccidioidomycosis with cough, fever, joint pain, and erythema nodosum. However, pulmonary involvement is present in >90% of patients with sarcoidosis, and most patients will have abnormal findings on chest x-ray (eg, hilar adenopathy). (Choices D and E) Although tuberculosis and tularemia may have varied presentations, this patient's negative tuberculin skin test, normal chest x-ray, and lack of relevant exposure history (eg, farm exposure or small animal handling for tularemia) make them less likely. Educational objective: Cough, fever, arthritis, and erythema nodosum after recent travel to the southwestern United States is consistent with coccidioidomycosis. Patients receiving tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including fungal pathogens.",

    "explanation": "Clostridium septicum is commonly associated with spontaneous gas gangrene. Unlike other Clostridium species (e.g., Clostridium perfringens), a history of trauma is not required for infection. Infection usually spreads hematogenously from GI tract pathology. Most patients have underlying colonic malignancy, but other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and diverticulitis have also been associated with C. septicum infection. Thus, all patients with C. septicum bacteremia should be evaluated with colonoscopy. (Choice B to E) Clostridium septicum is not usually associated with lung, bladder, prostate, or cardiac pathology. Educational objective: Clostridium septicum usually presents with bacteremia followed by spontaneous gas gangrene in an extremity without a history of trauma.

    "choice_d": "Strict use of soap and water for hand hygiene",
    "choice_e": "Wearing surgical mask in the vicinity of the patient",
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Neisseria meningitidis is the leading cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in children and young adults. Most cases begin with severe myalgias followed by a petechial/hemorrhagic rash, fever, and meningeal signs. Patients often deteriorate rapidly and usually present ≤24 hours after symptom onset. N meningitidis is transmitted by aerosolized droplets and is highly contagious; all patients with suspected meningococcal meningitis should be put on droplet precautions for at least 24 hours after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. As part of these precautions, health care personnel should wear surgical masks when they are within 6 feet of the patient. (Choice A) Contact precautions are typically used to prevent spread of multidrug resistant bacteria (eg, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and some enteric organisms such as Clostridium difficile. Gloves and gowns are required for interaction with the patient. (Choice B) Airborne isolation involves a negative air pressure room and is typically used for organisms that are transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei (<5 microns) such as tuberculosis, varicella, and measles. Droplet nuclei are smaller than aerosolized droplets and can stay suspended in the air for several hours; as such, droplet nuclei require airborne isolation whereas aerosolized droplets do not. (Choice C) Standard precautions should be used in the care of all patients and include hand hygiene, gowns/glove/eye protection if exposure to fluids is likely, and safe injection practices. This patient with likely meningococcal meningitis requires droplet precautions in addition to standard precautions. (Choice D) Potential C difficile infection requires the use of soap and water for hand hygiene as alcohol-based hand rubs do not eradicate C difficile spores. This patient does not have watery diarrhea or risk factors for C difficile (eg, recent antimicrobial therapy). Educational objective: Patients with potential meningococcal meningitis require at least 24 hours of droplet precautions after the initiation of antibiotics in order to prevent transmission to individuals in close contact. Droplet precautions include the use of a surgical mask when an individual is within 6 feet of the source patients.",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Acute onset of fevers, allergic-type symptoms (urticarial lesions, angioedema), and robust eosinophilia in the setting of a recent trip to sub-Saharan Africa with freshwater exposure is suggestive of acute schistosomiasis syndrome (Katayama fever). This is a systemic hypersensitivity reaction against schistosomal eggs and larvae, typically occurring 14-28 days after infection. Chest x-ray infiltrates may be present. Microscopic examination for schistosomiasis eggs and serologic testing may be negative in acute schistosomiasis. The episode is usually self-limiting (days to weeks), and management is with corticosteroids during the acute phase followed by antihelminthic therapy (eg, praziquantel) to prevent long-term sequelae of helminth infection (eg, hydronephrosis, bladder squamous cell carcinoma). (Choice A) Amebiasis typically manifests with nonspecific or gastrointestinal symptoms (flatulence, diarrhea, lactose intolerance, malabsorption). Fever would be rare. (Choice B) Unremitting high fevers and severe polyarthralgia would be more characteristic of Chikungunya fever. (Choice C) Cutaneous leishmaniasis is due to a protozoan parasite transmitted to humans via sandfly bites. It usually presents as a nonpruritic red papule that forms an ulcer with granulomatous tissue at the base and raised margins. (Choice D) Malaria is not classically associated with urticarial lesions or eosinophilia. This patient's normal hemoglobin and platelet counts and her compliance with prophylaxis make malaria a less likely diagnosis. Educational objective: Consider acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) among patients presenting with fever and eosinophilia after return from an endemic area, including sub-Saharan Africa. Corticosteroids and supportive care are indicated in the acute setting followed by antiparasitic treatment after acute symptoms resolve.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This older patient has all 3 classic manifestations (high fever, neck stiffness, altered mental state) of acute bacterial meningitis. Most cases are due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (~70%), but Neisseria meningitidis, group B streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Listeria monocytogenes (in those age >50) are also common culprits. The underlying organism is typically identified by blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures. Patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis require urgent empiric treatment to limit neurologic sequelae and reduce the risk of death. First-line antibiotic therapy includes ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin (added for those age >50 to empirically cover L monocytogenes). In addition, dexamethasone is given just prior to or with the first dose of empiric antibiotics to reduce neurologic sequelae (eg, hearing loss) and mortality in those with pneumococcal meningitis; it should be discontinued if CSF gram stain or culture (or blood culture) indicates infection with a nonpneumococcal organism. Most patients are initiated on treatment after blood cultures and lumbar puncture. However, those who require a head CT scan prior to lumbar puncture (eg, altered mental state, new seizure, focal deficit, immunocompromise, central nervous system disease, papilledema) should first receive empiric therapy to limit treatment delays. (Choice A) Acyclovir is used to treat herpes encephalitis, which commonly presents with high fever, altered mental status, seizure, and/or focal neurologic deficits but is rarely associated with neck stiffness or nuchal rigidity. Most (85%) cases of herpes meningitis are accompanied by genital lesions. Compared to bacterial meningitis, herpes central nervous system (CNS) infections are less likely to cause marked hypotension (as seen in this patient) in the absence of immunosuppression. Although patients undergoing empiric treatment for bacterial meningitis sometimes receive concurrent empiric acyclovir therapy until herpes CNS infection is ruled out, acyclovir would not be used alone. (Choices B and D) Cefepime or meropenem are used in place of ceftriaxone for the empiric treatment of bacterial meningitis when patients have underlying immunocompromise or health care-associated meningitis (eg, head trauma, recent neurosurgery) to cover for opportunistic bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This patient has no evidence of immunocompromise or risk for health care-associated meningitis. (Choice E) Because this patient is age >50, he requires ampicillin to cover for L monocytogenes. In addition, dexamethasone is required to reduce adverse outcomes in the setting of possible pneumococcal meningitis. Educational objective: Patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis require urgent empiric treatment with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Ampicillin should be added for those age >50 to empirically cover for Listeria monocytogenes. All patients should also receive adjunctive dexamethasone to reduce risk of neurologic sequelae and death from potential pneumococcal meningitis.",

The vesicular, crusty skin eruption on her forehead also involves the eyelids, with evidence of edema and drooping. She is at risk of developing herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). HZO is a serious, vision-threatening complication of reactivation of varicella zoster virus in the trigeminal nerve root ganglion. Some patients present with headache, malaise, eye pain, and fever before developing a rash on the face. Once the rash develops, patients can also have conjunctivitis, keratitis, or episcleritis. Vesicles near the nose are also associated with a high risk of HZO. Patients at risk for herpes zoster ophthalmicus require an urgent ophthalmology consultation. Immunocompromised patients with sight-threatening ophthalmicus should receive intravenous acyclovir. When urgent evaluation by an ophthalmologist is not available, topical steroid eye drops can be used to decrease the inflammatory response. (Choices A & E) Gabapentin and topical capsaicin can provide relief from pain of post-herpetic neuralgia, defined as persistent pain after resolution of the initial rash. However, these agents are not helpful for pain from acute neuritis. (Choice B) The risk of aseptic meningitis is higher in immunocompromised than immunocompetent (0.5%) individuals. This patient has no meningeal signs or risk factors for immunosuppression; hence, a lumbar puncture is not needed at this time.

    "choice_d": "Entamoeba histolytica infection",
    "choice_e": "Inflammatory bowel disease",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation (loose stools, abdominal pain, and significant leukocytosis developing days after antibiotic therapy) is most consistent with a diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). C difficile can present in a variety of ways (Table), but it usually colonizes normal gut flora altered by antibiotic use. Symptoms typically start during antibiotic therapy or 5-10 days afterward. Penicillins, fluoroquinolones, and clindamycin are most commonly associated with CDI; however, virtually any antibiotic may be involved. Lower abdominal tenderness, nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea with mucus or occult blood are common presentations. Diagnosis is suggested by clinical findings and recent antibiotic use; C difficile stool studies can be confirmatory. If there is high clinical suspicion, empiric treatment with oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin can be considered when awaiting test results. Fulminant disease (eg, hypotension, ileus, megacolon) requires the addition of intravenous metronidazole to high dose-vancomycin. Patients who are refractory to treatment may need further evaluation with colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy; however, extreme caution should be used in patients with fulminant colitis due to perforation risk. (Choice A) Appendicitis most commonly presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, anorexia, and nausea/vomiting. However, this patient has had multiple episodes of loose stools over the past 2 days, and his abdomen is soft and diffusely tender (without rebound tenderness, making peritonitis less likely). This presentation makes infectious diarrhea with colitis more likely than appendicitis. (Choice C) Endotoxin-producing Shigella usually presents with bloody, mucoid diarrhea; fever and abdominal pain. It resolves spontaneously in most patients. This patient's current episode of diarrhea is more likely due to C difficile given the high degree of leukocytosis; lack of bloody, mucoid diarrhea; and timing of symptoms shortly after antibiotic use. (Choice D) The majority (~90%) of Entamoeba histolytica infections are asymptomatic, whereas symptomatic patients have bloody diarrhea with abdominal pain. Symptoms usually have a subacute onset over 1-3 weeks. (Choice E) Inflammatory bowel disease usually presents with the gradual onset of diarrhea after previous self-limited episodes of rectal bleeding/diarrhea. This patient's timing of symptoms following antibiotic use makes this less likely. Educational objective: Clostridium difficile infection usually presents with multiple episodes of watery diarrhea after recent antibiotic use. Diagnosis is confirmed by stool studies, and treatment involves oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. Patients refractory to treatment may need further investigation with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient with recent travel to Sub-Saharan Africa has an acute-onset febrile illness, scleral icterus, mild splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. This presentation is most consistent with malaria. Plasmodium falciparum accounts for the majority of deaths from malaria, followed by Plasmodium vivax. Many of the clinical symptoms seen in malaria are due to the infected parasite-containing red blood cells adhering to nearby vessels, causing small infarcts, leakage of capillaries, and, ultimately, organ dysfunction. Diagnosis is confirmed with examination of a peripheral blood smear looking for trophozoites. Commonly used malaria prophylaxis drugs (eg, chloroquine, mefloquine, and doxycycline) target the blood stage of the parasite (blood schizonticides) when released from the liver. Tissue schizonticides (eg, atovaquone/proguanil) are designed to target the liver stage, where the parasites grow and can stay dormant in the liver (or other tissues). The blood schizonticides must be continued for at least 4 weeks after leaving an endemic area to ensure eradication of parasites released from the liver. This patient did take doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis but discontinued his medication on return to the United States, causing it to be ineffective. (Choice A) Blood culture is of limited utility in the diagnosis of malaria as the organism cannot be cultured in traditional media. For bacterial infections such as salmonellosis (typhoid fever), fungal infection, and meningococcemia, blood cultures would be an appropriate diagnostic test. (Choice B) In the absence of meningeal signs (eg, neck stiffness and rash) lumbar puncture is less helpful. (Choice D) Acute viral hepatitis can cause jaundice and right upper-quadrant pain but would not result in anemia and splenomegaly. (Choice E) Stool sample for ova and parasites would be helpful for infections such as schistosomiasis, but this patient did not drink fresh water or swim during his travels. The lack of eosinophilia argues against this testing. Educational objective: Malaria should be considered in a traveler returning from an endemic area who has acute febrile illness, anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. Persons who have received inadequate prophylaxis are at risk. Identification of the parasite on peripheral blood smear can establish the diagnosis.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient with poor dentition and a history of mitral valve prolapse has low-grade fever, arthralgias, and likely mitral regurgitation (apex murmur radiating to axilla), raising concern for infective endocarditis (IE). Further evaluation with 3 sets of blood cultures and echocardiography is now required to estimate the likelihood of IE using the modified Duke criteria. Patients with suspected IE also usually receive a chest x-ray, ECG, and additional laboratory studies. Common laboratory abnormalities include normochromic/normocytic anemia, leukocytosis with left shift, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (90% of cases), decreased complement levels (C3, C4, and CH50), and positive rheumatoid factor due to circulating immune complexes. Imaging of the spine for vertebral myelitis or abdomen for splenic infarcts (as is likely in this case) is also warranted in the appropriate clinical setting. (Choice A) Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are commonly seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. Although both syndromes can be associated with arthralgias and systemic symptoms, most patients also have ear (eg, otitis), nose (eg, rhinorrhea, sinusitis), throat (eg, hoarseness), and/or renal manifestations (eg, glomerulonephritis). Cardiac involvement would be atypical. (Choice C) Bone marrow biopsy is most commonly performed to evaluate for hematologic malignancy. Although this patient does have splenomegaly and complete blood count abnormalities, given her dental disease, mitral valve prolapse, and constellation of manifestations, she should first undergo an evaluation for IE with blood cultures and echocardiogram. Splenomegaly can sometimes be seen with IE. If the modified Duke criteria reveals a low probability of IE, she may require bone marrow biopsy for further evaluation. (Choice D) Cervical smear and culture could diagnosis Neisseria gonorrhea infection. Disseminated gonococcus can cause a triad of symptoms (ie, tenosynovitis, pustular skin lesions, polyarthralgias) or purulent arthritis without skin lesions. This patient with polyarthritis has a cardiac murmur, splenomegaly, and no skin lesions, making IE more likely. (Choice E) Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Although this patient visited an endemic region (the northeastern United States), Lyme carditis typically presents with atrioventricular conduction block or decreased contractility due to myopericarditis. A new cardiac murmur and splenomegaly are more suggestive of IE. Educational objective: Patients with suspected infective endocarditis require blood cultures (3 sets) and echocardiography to estimate its likelihood using the modified Duke criteria.",

    "choice_e": "Wound culture and close observation",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with a cat bite resulting in a deep puncture wound to the hand. Cat bites can be quite deep. Although cat saliva contains multiple different bacteria (eg, Streptococcus and anaerobic bacteria), Pasturella multocida is found in nearly 50% of cat bites. These infections, particularly when located on extremities, can progress to bone and/or joint infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce infection rates and is recommended for animal bite wounds near lymphatics and blood vessels, on the hand, close to joints and/or bones, requiring surgical intervention, and in immunocompromised hosts. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is preferred for prophylaxis and doxycycline/metronidazole is recommended in patients with penicillin allergy. Doxycycline or TMP-SMX-based regimens also are used to treat MRSA infections in high-risk patients. Antibiotics ineffective against P multocida include first-generation cephalosporins (cephalexin), penicillinase-resistant penicillins (dicloxacillin), and macrolides (erythromycin) (Choice A). Wounds should be irrigated with debris removal and should be left open to heal by secondary intention rather than primary closure (Choice C). Careful follow-up is warranted to assess for deeper infection that may require extended antibiotic therapy. Primary closure may be done at that time if there are no signs of infection. Nonhealing wounds will likely require surgical debridement. Patients should also receive tetanus booster if indicated and be considered for rabies vaccine. (Choice D) Tetanus immunoglobulin is recommended for patients with high-risk bites who have not been recently immunized against tetanus (<=5 years). (Choice E) Wound culture following animal bites has not been demonstrated to be clinically useful. Some organisms, including P multocida, are fastidious and difficult to grow in culture. Educational objective: Prophylactic antibiotics are warranted following a cat bite with deep injury. Antibiotic coverage should include an agent that treats Pasturella multocida. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is preferred as first-line therapy, and doxycycline/metronidazole is used in patients with penicillin allergy.",

Cardiac examination reveals a faint diastolic murmur at the left sternal border. Skin examination shows needle track marks on both arms. All 4 bottles of blood cultures obtained on admission grow Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible). Intravenous cefazolin is initiated. A transthoracic echocardiogram reveals a 0.9 cm aortic valve vegetation with mild aortic regurgitation and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. On the third day of hospitalization, he is intermittently febrile and develops respiratory failure. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is initiated. Chest x-ray reveals bilateral alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient with aortic valve endocarditis was initially appropriately treated with intravenous antibiotics. However, his sudden clinical deterioration with respiratory failure and pulmonary edema suggests a mechanical complication of endocarditis. The most common cause of acute congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients with infective endocarditis is valvular insufficiency, either due to valve leaflet perforation or worsening regurgitation. The best next step for evaluation is a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). TEE is superior to TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) for detecting complications such as leaflet perforation, aneurysm formation, and secondary infection of other valve structures. Refractory CHF due to mitral or aortic valvular insufficiency from an infected valve is an indication for surgery. (Choice A) Early CHF in a patient with endocarditis is not an indication of microbiologic treatment failure. Moreover, addition of gentamicin is not recommended for the treatment of native valve endocarditis as the risk of nephrotoxicity outweighs the potential benefit. (Choice B) Rifampin is used as an essential component of the antibiotic regimen for treatment of staphylococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis. However, it is not recommended for native valve endocarditis. (Choice C) Vancomycin is recommended for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus endocarditis. However, this patient has a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strain and switching antibiotics is not indicated. (Choice D) A CT scan of the chest will likely reveal bilateral pulmonary edema as seen on the chest x-ray, but would not show valvular pathology and is unlikely to add additional diagnostic information. TEE is more appropriate for definitive diagnosis in this setting. Educational objective: Transesophageal echocardiogram is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis and its complications; it should be obtained early in patients with suspected complications or sudden clinical deterioration.",

A history of abdominal surgery and possible splenectomy also increases the risk of meningococcal disease. Droplet precautions and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis should be instituted for those in close contact with the patient (eg, family members, healthcare workers). Droplet precautions should be in effect for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy and involve wearing a facemask if within 6-10 feet of the patient. Use of a higher-level respirator mask or closing the door of the patient's room is not necessary. Rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone are the recommended antibiotic chemoprophylaxis drugs for persons at risk. (Choices A, B, and D) Neisseria meningitidis is transmitted via droplets. Unlike infectious agents transmitted in an airborne mode, it usually does not spread more than 3 feet. Educational objective: For patients with meningococcal infection, droplet precautions should be in effect for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy and involve wearing a facemask if within 6-10 feet of the patient.

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with infection by Yersinia pestis (bubonic plague), a gram-negative coccobacillus transmitted by infected fleas. The main Yersinia pathogens include Y. pestis, Y. enterocolitica, and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Yersinia pestis causes plague, while the other two cause diarrheal illnesses. It is transmitted by infected fleas from rodents, scratches/bites from infected cats, eating contaminated food, direct handling of infected animals, and respiratory transmission from infected humans. Urban plague involves rats, which have been the major reservoir for human epidemics. Diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion in patients with travel to endemic areas (e.g., Southwestern US) or animal exposure, and unexplained fever with regional lymphadenitis. Diagnosis can be confirmed with blood cultures, fluid culture (e.g., bubo aspirate or CSF), peripheral blood smear (Wright-Giemsa stain) showing rod-shaped organisms, or serologic titers. Untreated disease can lead to bacteremia, multiorgan failure, and death in nearly 75% of patients. Suspected patients should be promptly treated with tetracyclines or streptomycin. Post-exposure prophylaxis with doxycycline is recommended for contact with known cases. (Choice A) Coccidioides immitis is endemic in the Southwestern United States. Patients usually have nonspecific systemic symptoms, dry cough, pneumonia, or skin lesions in the immunocompromised. This patient's regional lymphadenitis is not usually seen in coccidiomycosis. (Choice B) Francisella tularensis (tularemia) is transmitted via contact with infected animals (e.g.. rabbits). Patients most commonly present with ulceroglandular disease with a single erythematous papular skin ulcer with central eschar, tender local lymphadenopathy, and sudden onset of systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, etc.). (Choice C) Pasteurella multocida infection results from bites or scratches from domestic pets. Patients usually present with localized cellulitis within 24 hours, regional lymphadenopathy, and sometimes bacteremia with osteomyelitis, meningitis, or endocarditis. (Choice D) Streptobacillus moniliformis commonly causes rat bite fever. Patients usually present with fever, severe myalgias, asymmetrical arthralgias, and a fine macular rash. However, it usually does not cause regional lymphadenitis. Educational objective: Yersinia pestis infection causes the highly lethal bubonic plague and presents with swollen and painful lymph nodules and sudden onset of high-grade fever. Suspected patients should be treated rapidly with tetracyclines or streptomycin. Post-exposure prophylaxis with doxycycline is recommended for contact with known cases.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient with HIV likely has Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) complicated by pneumothorax. A subacute course with dyspnea, dry cough, and fever is classic for PCP. Other symptoms include chest pain, malaise, weight loss, headache, night sweats, chills, and fatigue. Of AIDS patients with PCP, 6%-7% may be asymptomatic. Lack of fever (as in this patient) does not exclude PCP, although it does make a bacterial or mycobacterial source less likely. Nearly 90% of patients have lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels >50 U/L above baseline; an LDH >450 U/L is predictive of PCP rather than another pulmonary process. Arterial blood gas analysis usually shows hypoxemia, an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, and respiratory alkalosis. The most commonly described radiographic appearance in PCP is interstitial infiltrates (unilateral, bilateral, or diffuse), although a normal chest x-ray can be seen. Thin-walled cavitary lesions may be present. Spontaneous pneumothorax develops in approximately 5% of PCP patients. Pneumothorax is thought to develop primarily in the setting of rupture of cystic lesions that may be present in active disease or remaining from an earlier infection. (Choices A and E) Many of this patient's symptoms are also features of mycobacterial infection. However, the constellation of pneumothorax, LDH > 450 IU/L, relatively short duration of symptoms, lack of documented fevers, and thin-walled cavity on radiograph makes PCP more likely. (Choice C) Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis is a subacute infection most commonly seen in patients with altered local defenses from pre-existing pulmonary disease or those with risk factors that alter systemic immune status. This infection is less likely given the lack of \"fungus ball\" appearance on chest x- ray and the likely only mild pre-existing pulmonary disease. (Choice D) Staphylococcal lung abscess can be seen in patients with septic emboli from endocarditis. This patient has a pneumothorax and not the multiple thick-walled cavities typical of septic emboli; he also has no fever or elevated white blood cell count. Educational objective: Nearly 90% of patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) will have lactic acid dehydrogenase levels >50 U/L above baseline; a level >450 U/L is predictive of PCP rather than another pulmonary process. The most commonly described radiographic appearance in PCP is diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Spontaneous pneumothorax develops in approximately 5% of patients.",

    "explanation": "This patient, who recently returned from a trip to the Dominican Republic, has a classic presentation for Chikungunya fever (acquired by a bite from an infected Aedes mosquito). This includes the abrupt onset of persistent high fevers and characteristic severe polyarthralgias (seen in virtually all cases and often involving multiple joint groups). Some patients develop a rash. Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are common; elevated transaminases may also be seen. Serologic studies (or polymerase chain reaction testing in the first 5 days) can confirm the diagnosis. The infection is most often self-limited, although a few patients develop serious complications; rheumatologic symptoms may persist after the acute phase. (Choice B) The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms and presence of arthralgias make enteric fever (eg, typhoid fever) less likely. Many enteric fevers are transmitted through consumption of contaminated water. (Choice C) Hantavirus is transmitted by rodents and can cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, typically 2-3 weeks following exposure. This patient has normal kidney function, no hemorrhage, no respiratory symptoms, and no rodent exposure history. (Choice D) Malaria would classically be accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Fevers are typically cyclical (unlike the unremitting fevers seen in this patient), and polyarthralgias would not be as prominent. (Choice E) Meningococcemia (with or without meningitis) would more commonly manifest as progressive rash, pronounced myalgias, and rapid hemodynamic deterioration.

Patients typically present with refractory fever (> 90%) to antibacterial and/or antifungal therapy, skin lesions (precede fungemia by approximately 5 days), and sinopulmonary infections (~75%). Diagnosis is suggested by skin biopsy (> 50% of patients) and/or positive blood cultures (~40% of patients) that usually grow a mold. Patients without a definitive skin biopsy diagnosis require tissue biopsy. Fusarium is resistant to many antifungal agents and carries a high mortality (60-80%) in immunocompromised patients, particularly those who are neutropenic or taking steroids. High-dose amphotericin B and/or voriconazole are most often used with varying degrees of success. Prevention is key with patients avoiding tap water or soil contact to areas of broken skin. (Choice A) Aspergillus fumigatus may cause pneumonia and skin lesions, but usually does not have positive blood cultures. Immunocompromised patients also tend to present more often with pulmonary complaints progressing to multi-organ failure rather than primary skin lesions. (Choice B) Candida albicans is a diploid fungus rather than a mold. Also, C. albicans typically presents in the first 60 days after organ transplantation with clusters of painless pustules on an erythematous base. (Choice D) Histoplasma capsulatum is a fungus that is rare in bone marrow transplant patients, but more common in patients with HIV, solid organ transplants, and in those taking anti-TNF therapy. (Choice E) Nocardia is a weakly staining gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria that forms partially acid-fast beaded branching filaments. Nocardiosis with skin disease usually presents as ulcerations, pyoderma, cellulitis, nodules, and subcutaneous abscesses. Educational objective: Fusariosis can occur in severely immunocompromised patients. Inoculation commonly occurs when breaks in the skin are exposed to tap water or soil. Patients can present with refractory fever, skin lesions, and pulmonary disease. Diagnosis is suggested by skin biopsy (> 50% of patients) and/or positive blood cultures (~40% of patients) that usually grow a mold. Treatment is with amphotericin B +/- voriconazole with varying efficacy.",

    "choice_d": "Methicillin-resistant S. aureus",
    "choice_e": "Mycobacterial infection",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of septic thrombophlebitis involving the internal jugular vein (Lemierre's syndrome). Infection is usually caused by the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium necrophorum. Previously healthy young adults are most commonly affected, and present with pharyngitis or dental infection. The infection may improve spontaneously, extend to the lateral pharyngeal space, or involve the carotid sheath (e.g., internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, vagus nerve) to produce a sepsis syndrome with a high mortality rate. The condition should be suspected in patients with a recent history of pharyngitis who develop neck pain, neck swelling, and persistent fever despite appropriate oral antibiotic therapy. Septic pulmonary emboli and other embolic phenomenon (e.g., arthritis, osteomyelitis) are common. Diagnosis is suggested by radiographic imaging showing internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis and is confirmed with blood or tissue cultures growing the causative oropharyngeal pathogen. Treatment usually involves 4 weeks of antibiotics that have anaerobic coverage, such as beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors (e.g., ampicillin-sulbactam), clindamycin, or carbapenems. (Choice B) Corynebacterium diphtheria infection usually presents with a sore throat with gray and white tonsillar exudates (pseudomembrane), cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and sometimes cutaneous ulcers. The infection can extend into the neck and respiratory tract to cause respiratory distress. However, septic emboli are not seen. (Choice C) Infectious mononucleosis usually presents as a systemic illness with fever, fatigue, sore throat with tonsillar exudates, splenomegaly, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. This patient's lack of splenomegaly and presence of septic emboli make this diagnosis less likely. (Choice D) MRSA can cause skin infections and pneumonia, but it is a less common cause of pharyngitis. (Choice E) Mycobacterial infection can cause cervical lymphadenitis with neck swelling, but it is usually more gradual in onset without the sudden appearance of systemic symptoms as seen in this patient. Educational objective: Septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein should be suspected in patients with a recent history of pharyngitis who develop neck pain, neck swelling, persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy, and cavitary lung lesions. Infection is usually due to the anaerobic organism Fusobacterium necrophorum. Treatment involves 4 weeks of antibiotics with anaerobic coverage.",

    "choice_e": "Vancomycin and clindamycin",
    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient who had nasal packing 3 days ago now has manifestations of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is usually caused by a powerful Staphylococcus aureus exotoxin, which acts as a superantigen and results in the widespread activation of T cells, leading to a massive inflammatory response. Most cases are associated with menstrual tampons, nasal packing, or surgical/postpartum wound infections. Staphylococcal TSS is marked by rapid-onset fever (>38.9 C [102 F]), hypotension, diffuse erythroderma, desquamating rash, and multiorgan failure. Encephalopathy can occur secondary to cerebral edema. S aureus can usually be isolated from the infection source, but blood cultures are rarely (<5%) positive. Management is focused on supportive therapy, removal of the foreign material (eg, nasal packing, tampon) or surgery (eg, wound infections), and the initiation of antistaphylococcal antibiotics. Clindamycin and vancomycin are used most commonly; clindamycin is highly effective at inhibiting toxin production. Eradication of S aureus from the nares with mupirocin may be considered after recovery. TSS can also be caused by group A streptococcus, but patients typically have a painful skin infection and are less likely to develop erythroderma. (Choice A) Meningococcemia can cause rapid-onset fever, altered mental status, hypotension, and rash. However, petechial rash (not erythroderma) is the norm, and patients also frequently have myalgias, meningeal signs, and headache. Suspected cases are usually treated empirically with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. (Choice B) Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne illness that usually begins with nonspecific systemic symptoms followed 3-5 days later by a maculopapular/petechial rash (starts on ankles/wrists and spreads centrally and to the palms/soles). Early treatment with doxycycline is required to prevent morbidity and death. (Choice C) Secondary syphilis is treated with penicillin G. Although secondary syphilis can cause a diffuse maculopapular rash, it is unlikely to cause rapid decompensation with hypotension. (Choice D) Vancomycin and cefepime would be indicated if this patient suffered a basal skull fracture during his fight and developed meningitis. Although he does have high fever and altered mental status, the presence of nasal packing, erythroderma, and multiorgan failure makes TSS more likely. Educational objective: Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) must be considered in patients with abrupt onset of fever, hypotension, and diffuse erythroderma. Most cases occur in the setting of menstrual tampons, nasal packing, or surgical/postpartum wound infections. Treatment involves supportive care, removing the foreign material (or surgery), and broad-spectrum antistaphylococcal antibiotics (eg, clindamycin and vancomycin).",

    "choice_c": "Empiric antimicrobials and corticosteroids",
    "choice_d": "Head CT scan without contrast",
    "choice_e": "Lumbar puncture",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient has high fever, neck pain, and altered mental status, the 3 classic manifestations of acute bacterial meningitis. Most cases are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but Neisseria meningitis, group B streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Listeria monocytogenes (in patients age >50) are also frequently isolated. Blood cultures and lumbar puncture (LP) are required for definitive diagnosis. Blood cultures successfully identify the underlying pathogen in 50%-90% of cases and should always be drawn prior to antimicrobials to maximize their yield. The timing of LP is more nuanced as patients with any of the following require a preceding noncontrast head CT scan: Altered mental status (as in this patient); Immunocompromised state; History of central nervous system disease; New-onset seizure; Papilledema; Focal neurologic deficit. Head CT scan often results in treatment delays of up to 6 hours, which can increase the risk of death and neurologic sequelae. As such, patients with suspected bacterial meningitis who require a head CT scan prior to LP should first receive empiric treatment with antibiotics and adjuvant dexamethasone (Choices D and E). Antimicrobial treatment prior to LP can reduce the yield of cerebrospinal fluid gram stain and culture, but most pathogens can still be successfully cultivated for 4-10 hours after antibiotic initiation. Patients who do not require a head CT scan prior to LP should undergo LP before the administration of antimicrobials. Most patients with suspected bacterial meningitis are also treated with empiric acyclovir to cover for possible herpes simplex encephalitis. (Choice A) Bedside electroencephalogram monitoring is often used to evaluate for nonconvulsive status epilepticus, which can occur in the setting of an infectious encephalopathy and lead to mental status changes. However, this patient should first receive empiric antibiotics; electroencephalogram can be considered if there is no mental status improvement. (Choice B) Brain MRI takes longer to perform than a head CT scan. Therefore, urgent noncontrast head CT scan is preferred in patients with acute mental status changes to rule out space-occupying lesions. Educational objective: Patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis require early treatment with empiric antibiotics and dexamethasone to limit neurologic sequelae and death. Those who need a head CT scan (eg, altered mental state, focal neurologic deficit, immunocompromised state, new-onset seizure, papilledema, history of central nervous system disease) prior to lumbar puncture should first receive blood cultures, antibiotics, and dexamethasone. Patients who do not require a head CT scan should receive blood cultures and lumbar puncture prior to treatment.",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient with a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy likely has complicated cystitis; in the outpatient setting, complicated cystitis is usually managed with an oral fluoroquinolone. However, fluoroquinolones are associated with a high risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and should generally be avoided in those with a history of CDAD when an alternate, lower-risk antibiotic is available (Choice C). The patient's recent episode of cystitis was due to pansensitive Escherichia coli; therefore, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole would likely provide adequate coverage while also conferring a low risk of CDAD. (Choice A) This patient has normal vital signs and no vomiting; he can be treated in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. In addition, broad-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are associated with a high risk of C difficile relapse. (Choice B) Broad-spectrum penicillins such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are highly associated with CDAD and should be avoided when possible in patients who have had recent CDAD infections. Although amoxicillin-clavulanic acid can be used to treat cystitis, it is more commonly administered for respiratory infections. (Choice D) Nitrofurantoin should not be used for men with cystitis as it does not reach reliable tissue concentrations and is less effective than other therapies if occult prostatitis is present. Educational objective: Patients with a history of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) should have careful antibiotic stewardship. Fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and broad-spectrum penicillins/cephalosporins are associated with high rates of CDAD; therefore, alternate antibiotics with a lower risk of CDAD should be used when possible.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation (fever, increased purulent respiratory secretions, and new right lower lobe infiltrate) is consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), defined as pneumonia occurring 48-72 hours after endotracheal intubation. Intubated patients are at higher risk for pneumonia due to aspiration of organisms colonizing the oropharyngeal tract, including hospital-acquired organisms. Common VAP organisms include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter. Current guidelines recommend coverage for the above organisms, especially MRSA (in areas of high incidence), with vancomycin or linezolid (both equally efficacious). However, linezolid is preferred in hospitals where a major portion of MRSA isolates have a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >= 2 mcg/mL. This patient was started on intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, which covers both MSSA and gram-negative pathogens well. However, he is not clinically improving and may have MRSA, thus he requires the addition of linezolid to his regimen. (Choice A) Azithromycin covers many gram-positive, atypical, and some gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Legionella). However, it is not effective against MRSA. (Choice B) Daptomycin is bactericidal with activity against MRSA, and is approved for treating skin and soft tissue infections and bacteremia with or without endocarditis. However, pulmonary surfactant inhibits the drug, making it less effective for treating pneumonia. (Choice D) Tigecycline is a tetracycline derivative approved for skin and soft tissue infections (including MRSA) and intraabdominal infections not caused by MRSA. However, its use is associated with increased mortality in patients with VAP. (Choice E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can treat MRSA skin and soft tissue infections, but there is no published data regarding its efficacy for pneumonia or other invasive MRSA infections. Educational objective: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) typically presents with fever, purulent secretions, and hypoxia in ventilated patients 48-72 hours after intubation. Common organisms include MRSA, MSSA, and gram- negative organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas). Vancomycin and linezolid are appropriate first-line agents for treating MRSA pneumonia.",

The patient has a history of Crohn disease and recently underwent abdominal surgery to remove a bowel stricture. The postoperative course was complicated by an enterocutaneous fistula, which has been treated over the past 6 weeks with antitumor necrosis factor therapy. This treatment has reduced the amount of drainage from the fistula. He has had no recent abdominal pain or diarrhea. The patient takes nothing by mouth and receives daily total parenteral nutrition.

    "choice_d": "Remove the catheter and begin intravenous caspofungin",
    "choice_e": "Repeat blood cultures and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient with budding yeasts on blood cultures likely has candidemia, a common hospital-acquired infection that is frequently linked to central venous catheters, total parenteral nutrition, and immunocompromised states (eg, neutropenia). Clinical manifestations are myriad and range from mild fever to full-blown sepsis with or without end-organ involvement (eg, chorioretinitis, endocarditis, meningitis). Blood cultures are the gold standard for diagnosis, but sensitivity is low (~50%) so serum markers (eg, beta-D-glucan) and/or biopsy with histology are sometimes required. The cornerstone of treatment for candidemia is: Central venous catheter removal - catheter removal speeds clearance of candidemia and reduces mortality rates; it should be performed when feasible (eg, alternate access is available); Empiric antifungal treatment - echinocandins such as caspofungin are first-line therapy due to excellent coverage against the most common infective species including Candida albicans, C glabrata, C tropicalis, C parapsilosis, and C krusei. All patients with candidemia should also undergo ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for endophthalmitis. (Choice A) Although fluconazole has excellent efficacy against C albicans, it does not adequately cover many strains of C glabrata and C krusei. As such, azoles are not generally used as a first-line empiric therapy for candidemia. Changing the catheter via guidewire increases the risk of septic emboli and may result in inoculation of the new catheter. (Choice B) The catheter should be removed if possible. Liposomal amphotericin B is considered a second-line agent for candidemia due to a greater risk of side effects (when compared to echinocandins). (Choice C) Catheter removal without antifungal treatment is associated with high mortality rates. Treatment should not be delayed for species and susceptibility results; this patient requires the prompt initiation of antifungal therapy. (Choice E) Gram stain evidence of budding yeasts on blood cultures should never be considered a contaminant. There is no need to repeat blood cultures; antifungal treatment should be initiated. Educational objective: Candidemia is a common hospital-acquired infection and usually occurs in the setting of a central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition, and/or an immunocompromised state (eg, neutropenia). The cornerstone of treatment is catheter removal and empiric antifungal therapy with an echinocandin (eg, caspofungin). Candida in blood cultures should never be considered a contaminant.",

    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is suggestive of typhoid fever, which is caused by Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi and is commonly seen in the developing world. Patients typically present with fever and bacteremia within 5-20 days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. They can also present later with abdominal pain and a characteristic erythematous, macular rash. Laboratory studies may show a normal platelet count, leukopenia or leukocytosis, and abnormal liver function tests. The most serious stage of typhoid fever is intestinal perforation (due to hyperproliferation of Peyer's patches), which can lead to peritonitis, bacteremia, septic shock, and death. Diagnosis is made by culture, and S typhi and S paratyphi can be isolated from stool, urine, and intestinal contents. However, bone marrow is the most sensitive (> 90%), with a higher yield of organisms than other body fluids. Blood cultures are usually performed out of convenience, but the sensitivity in isolating S typhi or S paratyphi ranges from 40%-80%. Bone marrow cultures can be particularly useful as they remain positive in a high percentage of patients who received antibiotics for several days prior to culture. (Choice A) Classic dengue fever presents with fever lasting 5-7 days, headache, retro-orbital pain, rash, and body aches (\"breakbone fever\"). Laboratory findings include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels. (Choice B) Leptospirosis presents with abrupt onset of fever, myalgias, headache, and abdominal pain. An important clinical feature is conjunctival suffusion (redness of the conjunctiva without inflammatory exudates), which is not present in most other infectious diseases. (Choice C) Patients with malaria present from an endemic region with nonspecific symptoms such as fever that waxes and wanes, chills, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. They usually have splenomegaly, and initial laboratory data show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Rash is not a common clinical feature of malaria. (Choice E) Patients with acute viral hepatitis usually present with fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and hepatomegaly. Common laboratory abnormalities include marked elevations in serum aminotransferases (> 1000 U/L and alanine aminotransferase > aspartate aminotransferase), total and direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Educational objective: Typhoid fever usually presents in patients with recent travel to an endemic region with fever, bacteremia, and relative bradycardia. Patients later develop abdominal pain and a macular rash. Bone marrow culture is the most sensitive method for isolating the causative organism.",

    "choice_a": "Change to amoxicillin plus clavulanate",
    "choice_b": "Continue amoxicillin for another 7 days",
    "choice_c": "CT scan of temporal bone",
    "choice_d": "Myringotomy with tympanostomy tube",
    "choice_e": "Nasopharyngoscopy",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient has acute otitis media. An allergic rhinitis or upper respiratory illness commonly precedes the onset of otitis media. Eustachian tube dysfunction or occlusion from inflammation is the primary factor in the pathogenesis. Blockage of the Eustachian tube causes fluid accumulation in middle ear, with subsequent bacterial growth. The 3 most common organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Patients usually complain of severe ear pain and hearing loss. Fever may not be present. An otoscopic examination may show redness, opacification, air-fluid level, and bulging of the tympanic membrane. Use of a pneumatic otoscope would reveal poor movability of the tympanic membrane when pneumatic pressure is applied. A tuning fork examination can add to the diagnosis by revealing conductive hearing loss. In an immunocompetent host with no previous history of otitis media, amoxicillin is considered first-line treatment. If symptoms do not improve within 48-72 hours, the patient should be re-examined for a possible new area of infection or inadequate therapy. In cases of antibiotic failure, amoxicillin-clavulanate is the next best therapy to cover beta-lactamase-producing H influenzae. For patients allergic to penicillin, alternatives to amoxicillin therapy are second-generation (eg, cefuroxime) or third-generation (eg, cefdinir) cephalosporins. In patients allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics, a macrolide (eg, azithromycin) can be used. (Choice C) A CT scan is usually done in patients who do not respond and/or develop complications despite being on an adequate antibiotic regimen. Common complications include mastoiditis, brain abscess, and lateral sinus thrombosis (need an MRI). This patient has no posterior ear pain, fever, or headache that would suggest extension of an infection. (Choice D) Myringotomy is used to aid middle ear drainage for individuals with unresolved chronic otitis media with effusion or mastoiditis. Neither is present in this patient. (Choice E) Nasopharyngoscopy can be considered in patients with recurrent otitis media (> 2 episodes in a 6-month period) to evaluate for other possible causes of Eustachian tube or nasopharyngeal obstruction (eg, malignancy). Educational objective: Adult otitis media is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of ear pain and conductive hearing loss as well as otoscopic findings of erythema, opacification, bulging, or air-fluid level of the tympanic membrane. Although amoxicillin is first-line antibiotic therapy, amoxicillin-clavulanate is a better choice if otitis media is unresolved in 48-72 hours.",

The swelling initially responded to antibiotics prescribed to him 2 months ago; however, it subsequently returned. His other medical problems include a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. His medications include metformin, glyburide, and lisinopril. He denies tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. His temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and respirations are 12/min. Eye examination reveals intact ocular movements. There is no nasal discharge or sinus tenderness. Palpation over the jaw reveals a 4 cm mass extending from the mandible that is raised, non-tender, and firm. There is a sinus tract extending to the skin with purulent and blood-tinged drainage. No erythema or fluctuance is noted. Examination of the oral cavity shows poor dentition with gingivitis, but no open lesions. There is neither anterior nor posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the physical examination is within normal limits.

    "choice_c": "Metronidazole",
    "choice_d": "Penicillin",
    "choice_e": "Prednisone",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with likely cervicofacial actinomycosis, which is most commonly seen in the mandibular region. Actinomyces is an anaerobic, gram-positive, and filamentous branching bacteria that colonizes the oral cavity. Patients with poor oral hygiene are more likely to develop infection. Patients typically present with a slowly growing, non-tender, and indurated mass that can form abscesses, fistulas, or draining sinus tracts. The organisms also form characteristic sulfur granules in the infected tissue and extend locally through tissue planes instead of lymphangitic or hematologic spread. Actinomycosis can mimic other conditions, such as malignancy or granulomatous disease (e.g., TB, sarcoid). Diagnosis is confirmed by tissue culture, but Actinomyces are fastidious organisms that can take up to 3 weeks to grow in culture. Intravenous penicillin for 4-6 weeks is preferred initially, followed by 6 to 12 months of oral penicillin. For patients with penicillin allergy, clindamycin is a reasonable alternative. Surgical excision may be required for more severe cases. (Choice A) Chemotherapy would treat malignancies (e.g., lymphoma) that can mimic this patient's presentation. However, malignant lesions typically do not decrease and then increase in size or form sinus tracts. (Choice B) Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone with activity against gram-negative infections, some gram- positive infections (e.g., streptococci), and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Although TB causes cervical lymphadenitis, it does not typically form sinus tracts as seen in this patient. (Choice C) Metronidazole is effective for many anaerobic and parasitic infections, but is not effective for actinomycosis. This patient's sinus tracts in the mandible region are more consistent with actinomycosis. (Choice E) Prednisone is used to treat a variety of autoimmune conditions and malignancy, but is not effective for actinomycosis. This patient's lack of other systemic symptoms makes autoimmune disease less likely. Educational objective: Cervicofacial actinomycosis most commonly presents in the mandibular region as a slowly growing, non- tender mass with characteristic sulfur granules. The infection can extend through tissue planes and form abscesses, fistulas, and draining sinus tracts. Diagnosis is confirmed by culture, and penicillin for 6-12 months is the preferred therapy.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient has acute pharyngitis and fulfills 3 of 4 Centor criteria (he does not fulfill the criterion of \"absence of cough\" given that he has a nonproductive cough). The most appropriate next step is to obtain a rapid antigen test to exclude group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis as untreated patients are at risk for developing complications (eg, rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis, peritonsillar abscess). The Centor criteria (tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, fever by history, and absence of cough) help determine the likelihood of GAS pharyngitis and guide further workup and treatment. Patients with 0-1 criteria do not require further work up or treatment (high negative predictive value). Patients with >=2 criteria should be evaluated with a rapid streptococcal antigen test (RSAT), which has high specificity. Some clinicians will treat GAS pharyngitis empirically if all 4 criteria are met. Guidelines may use different cutoffs, but the presence of 3 criteria (as in this patient) generally warrants testing. (Choice A) Antibiotics are indicated in patients with a positive RSAT or those who fulfill 4 Centor criteria. Oral penicillin V and amoxicillin are common first-line agents due to their modest cost, narrow spectrum, and tolerability. First-generation cephalosporins (eg, cephalexin) are an alternate therapy if treatment fails. Macrolides (eg, erythromycin) are used for penicillin-allergic patients. (Choice B) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are appropriate for symptomatic relief of pain associated with nonspecific pharyngitis, but this patient should first be evaluated with an RSAT. (Choice C) Infectious mononucleosis (IM) can present in a similar fashion, but it is more common in patients age 15-24. Other signs and symptoms that are commonly seen with IM but are absent in this patient include fatigue (90%-100%), posterior lymphadenopathy (100%), and splenomegaly (60%). (Choice E) Although throat culture has high sensitivity and specificity in identifying GAS infection, the delay in obtaining results often limits its use in the acute setting. Throat culture can be considered in patients who have a negative RSAT result yet in whom the suspicion for GAS infection is still high (eg, 4 positive Centor criteria with negative RSAT). Educational objective: The Centor criteria (tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, fever by history, and absence of cough) are widely used to determine the likelihood of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Patients with >=2 criteria should have a rapid streptococcal antigen test and receive therapy with oral penicillin or amoxicillin if test results are positive.",

    "choice_e": "Prompt antiviral treatment of the outbreaks",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is common, particularly in patients with HSV-2. Partner transmission can occur in HSV-discordant couples due to asymptomatic viral shedding and symptomatic shedding during the prodromal period and active outbreaks. Multiple prevention strategies are available for discordant couples and have varying degrees of effectiveness. Patients with a history of HSV that was not confirmed by diagnostic testing (eg, viral culture) require serologic testing to determine infection status and type. It is also recommended that their sexual partners undergo evaluation to determine susceptibility. In immunocompetent heterosexual HSV-discordant couples, daily suppressive therapy (eg, valacyclovir) is the most effective strategy for reducing HSV transmission as it reduces asymptomatic viral shedding, decreases the number of outbreaks, and shortens outbreak duration. (Choice A) Patients can transmit HSV while asymptomatic (ie, viral shedding); therefore, abstinence limited to 2 weeks after an active outbreak is not the most effective method of transmission prevention. (Choice C) Meta-analysis has shown that male circumcision does not reduce HSV-2 transmission. (Choice D) Consistent condom use significantly reduces HSV male-to-female transmission. However, studies have shown a nonsignificant reduction of female-to-male transmission; therefore, condom use is not the most effective strategy in this patient. (Choice E) Medication taken during outbreaks may shorten the duration of symptoms. However, episodic treatment does not prevent HSV transmission due to viral shedding during the prodromal period. Educational objective: Herpes simplex virus transmission can occur with asymptomatic viral shedding and during prodromal phases and active lesions. The most effective strategy for reducing transmission is daily suppressive therapy.",

    "explanation": "This patient has vomiting-predominant gastroenteritis and negative stool culture suggestive of norovirus. Norovirus is the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis and is now the most common cause of all gastroenteritis in adults and children. Norovirus is spread via fecal-oral contamination, and the virus can be transmitted from food and water, fomites, or airborne droplets from vomitus. Norovirus commonly occurs in institutionalized and travel settings such as nursing homes, health care facilities, restaurants, and cruise ships. Norovirus can cause: 1. Asymptomatic infection, 2. Fever with watery diarrhea noninflammatory small-bowel process, 3. Severe illness - fever, vomiting, headache, and other systemic symptoms. Vomiting is prominent in norovirus-induced gastroenteritis. Symptoms usually start suddenly and last 48-72 hours. Diagnosis is generally clinical and most patients improve with supportive care. If needed, diagnosis can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or nucleic acid-based testing. (Choice A) Campylobacter infection most commonly presents with acute onset of cramping abdominal pain and inflammatory diarrhea (mucus, blood). Diagnosis is by stool culture. (Choice B) Clostridium perfringens is typically associated with traumatic gas gangrene, but it is also an important cause of watery diarrhea. The spores of C perfringens germinate in warm food and, once ingested, the bacteria produce a toxin in the gastrointestinal tract that causes disease. Fever and vomiting are uncommon symptoms. (Choice C) Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is the most common causative agent of travelers' diarrhea, but is much less frequently a cause of diarrhea in institutional settings. It presents classically with malaise, anorexia, and abdominal cramps followed by the acute onset of watery diarrhea. (Choice D) Listeria monocytogenes is a rare cause of epidemic gastroenteritis (usually associated with deli meats and soft cheeses). In addition to watery diarrhea, fever, and nausea/vomiting, L monocytogenes gastroenteritis may also present with prominent non-gastrointestinal symptoms such as myalgia, arthralgia, and headache. Diagnosis can be confirmed from special stool culture media. Educational objective: Norovirus is the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis in adults and children. Vomiting is more prominent.

    "explanation": "Many tickborne diseases present with flu-like illnesses. However, this patient's presentation (high and prolonged high fever, leukopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, and rash confined to the trunk without central clearing) is suggestive of human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis and transmitted by the Amblyomma americanum (lone star) tick. HME typically occurs in the spring and summer months in the southeastern and south central United States. It is similar to human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), another form of ehrlichiosis (seen primarily in the northeastern and midwestern United States and rarely associated with rash) that is transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick, which is also the vector for Lyme disease and babesiosis. Ehrlichiosis is usually suspected clinically. Peripheral blood smear may show the characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions (morulae) in neutrophils. Indirect fluorescent antibody testing with antibodies specific to the organism is the preferred confirmatory test. Untreated HME patients can suffer serious complications (seizures, renal/respiratory failure) with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients should receive empiric doxycycline, which also treats Rocky Mountain spotted fever (often difficult to differentiate from HME or HGA in the early stages). (Choice A) Babesia microti causes babesiosis and presents with high fever, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. However, rash and leukopenia are uncommon in babesiosis. A definitive diagnosis is made by finding parasitized red blood cells on thin blood smear. (Choice B) Lyme disease usually presents at the site of a tick bite with erythema migrans, which demonstrates central clearing and expands as the lesion progresses. However, leukopenia, high fever, and thrombocytopenia are uncommon in Lyme disease. (Choice C) Colorado tick fever is transmitted by the tick Dermacentor andersoni and occurs in the Rocky Mountain regions (western United States and Canada) at >4.000 feet elevation. Although this viral illness can present with similar symptoms, this patient's lack of travel history to the mountains makes this diagnosis unlikely. Most (>80%) patients with Colorado tick fever do not develop a rash. (Choice E) Rickettsia rickettsii causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and can look similar in its early stages to HME, but leukopenia is less common in RMSF. In addition, the RMSF rash (seen in 90% of patients) usually begins on the extremities. Educational objective: Ehrlichial infection is commonly caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis (human monocytic ehrlichiosis [HME]) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis [HGA]). Ehrlichiosis presents with severe and prolonged fever, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Rash without central clearing is infrequent in HME and very rare in HGA. Doxycycline is the preferred treatment.",

    "explanation": "Syphilis is typically transmitted by direct contact with infected lesions on the genitalia, lips, oral cavity, or breasts. Although most transmission occurs during the first year of infection, patients exposed sexually to an individual at any stage of syphilis should be evaluated and treated appropriately. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend that a patient exposed within 90 days prior to the diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis in a sex partner should receive presumptive treatment (even if the patient is seronegative for syphilis). A patient exposed >90 days before diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis in a sex partner can undergo serologic testing and treatment accordingly. Presumptive treatment should be given if serologic results are not immediately available or follow-up is uncertain. Long-term sex partners of patients with latent syphilis should also be evaluated with serologic testing and treated appropriately. Although CDC guidelines recommend that nontreponemal tests (eg, rapid plasma reagin) be performed first and that treponemal tests (eg, Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay) be used for confirmation, many laboratories have switched the order due to cost-related reasons (Choices B and C). (Choice D) Due to emerging macrolide (azithromycin) resistance in many areas, doxycycline is preferred as an alternative to benzathine penicillin for treating syphilis in penicillin-allergic patients. However, this patient has no documented penicillin allergy and should receive benzathine penicillin. Educational objective: A patient exposed within 90 days of diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis in a sex partner should receive treatment (even if the patient is seronegative for syphilis).

    "choice_e": "Tuberculin skin testing",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is the most common cause of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) disease. It includes (among others) M avium and M intracellulare, together termed M avium- intracellulare (MAI). MAC is ubiquitous and can be found in aerosolized water, piped hot water systems (eg, household and hospital water supplies, bathrooms), house dust, soil, birds, and farm animals. It can contaminate or colonize patients' sputum, especially in those who are immunocompromised or with underlying lung disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). The presentation can be similar to M tuberculosis (MTB) infection, and sputum can stain positive for acid- fast bacilli. The diagnosis requires clinical (chest x-ray with nodular or cavitary lesions, or CT with multifocal bronchiectasis and nodules) and microbiologic (22 positive sputum cultures for MAC, 1 positive culture from bronchial wash/lavage, or lung biopsy with consistent findings and positive culture) criteria with the exclusion of other relevant conditions. Treatment in confirmed cases includes at least a year of combination therapy with a macrolide (eg, clarithromycin, azithromycin), ethambutol, and a rifamycin (eg, rifampin, rifabutin). (Choice A) Antimycobacterial therapy with an isoniazid-containing 4-drug regimen would be the treatment for MTB, not NTM, disease. (Choice C) Bronchoscopy with biopsy is invasive and not required in this patient, who already fulfills diagnostic criteria for NTM. Bronchoscopy may be required if noninvasive tests (eg, sputum samples) are negative in a symptomatic patient in whom NTM disease is suspected. (Choice D) Long-term therapy with inhaled corticosteroids may increase NTM risk. However, fluticasone discontinuation may exacerbate this patient's COPD; NTM therapy rather than observation should be considered in this symptomatic patient. (Choice E) Tuberculin skin test (TST) is used for diagnosis of latent MTB infection. The false-positive rate due to NTM is 1%-5%. There is no indication for a TST as NTM infection is proven by nuclear acid probe. Educational objective: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is commonly found in the environment and can present similarly to M tuberculosis. Patients with underlying lung disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are particularly predisposed to developing MAC and require at least 2 positive sputum cultures to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment with macrolides, ethambutol, and rifamycins is usually started after diagnostic confirmation.",

The peripheral blood smear demonstrates intraerythrocytic ring forms with tetrads, termed the \"Maltese cross,\" a distinguishing feature of babesiosis. Patients with splenectomy are at high risk for severe Babesia infection, which can manifest as congestive heart failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or disseminated intravascular coagulation, among other conditions. (Choice A) Anaplasma phagocytophilum is the causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). Although the risk factors for anaplasmosis are similar to those of babesiosis and both are carried by the same tick vector (Ixodes scapularis), the peripheral smear in HGA typically shows intracytoplasmic inclusions in granulocytes. (Choice C) Borrelia burgdorferi is the spirochete that causes Lyme disease. Intraerythrocytic organisms would not be seen with Lyme disease. (Choice D) Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis, a tickborne disease in which ehrlichiae infect monocytes, not erythrocytes. (Choice E) Although the patient traveled to a malaria-endemic area and did not take prophylaxis, the presence of Maltese cross tetrads and the absence of schizonts, gametocytes, and malarial pigment on the blood smear distinguish babesiosis from malaria. Furthermore, the incubation period for plasmodium malaria is typically 1-2 weeks, so presentation >3 months following exposure would be unusual. Educational objective: The diagnosis of babesiosis can be established based on identification of organisms on a thin blood smear (intraerythrocytic ring forms with Maltese cross tetrads).

    "stem": "A 50-year-old man comes to the physician with complaints of low-grade fever, malaise, and intermittent diarrhea. He experiences a burning sensation in his chest when he swallows food. He received a living related-donor kidney transplant 5 months ago. The donor and recipient were both cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G antibody positive and Epstein-Barr virus antibody positive. Valganciclovir prophylaxis was given for 100 days. The patient experienced an acute cellular rejection 3 weeks ago that was diagnosed after kidney biopsy. He was treated with pulse methylprednisolone and a change from cyclosporine to tacrolimus. His rejection was successfully treated and his kidney function stabilized. On examination, the patient is in no distress. His temperature is 38.1 C (100.5 F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. Pulse oximetry is 97% on room air. Ocular fundi show no exudates or papilledema. The remainder of his physical examination is within normal limits. Laboratory results are as follows: Hematocrit 34% Platelets 150,000/ μL Leukocytes 3,800/μL Neutrophils 40% Eosinophils 3% Lymphocytes 50% Monocytes 6% Sodium 142 mEq/L Potassium 4.6 mEq/L Chloride 102 mEq/L Bicarbonate 24 mEq/L Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL Glucose 120 mg/dL Aspartate aminotransferase 112 U/L Alanine aminotransferase 124 U/L A chest x-ray is normal and unchanged from a pre-transplant film. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's illness?",
    "choice_a": "BK viral infection",
    "choice_b": "Cytomegalovirus disease",
    "choice_c": "Herpes simplex infection",
    "choice_d": "Tacrolimus toxicity",
    "choice_e": "Toxoplasma gondii infection",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. CMV infection is defined as detection of CMV antibodies, antigen, DNA, or virus without significant clinical symptoms. CMV disease is usually associated with a rejection episode and increased immunosuppression. Patients typically develop a mononucleosis- like illness with low-grade fever, malaise, leukopenia, and some degree of organ involvement (eg, hepatitis, pancreatitis, colitis, meningoencephalitis, and pneumonitis). CMV eye disease is more common in HIV than organ transplant patients. CMV disease is more common in CMV-positive donors and CMV-positive recipients. Several strains of cytomegalovirus do not confer cross-immunity. Recipients may have reactivation of existing virus or superinfection with a new donor viral strain. This patient was appropriately treated with valgancicyclovir (preferred prophylactic for CMV) for the first 3 months following transplantation but had organ rejection with a change in immunosuppression. Treatment usually involves immunosuppression reduction and antiviral therapy (eg, ganciclovir) for more severe disease. However, cyclosporine or tacrolimus is not discontinued unless there is life-threatening disease. (Choice A) BK viral infection occurs in about 5% of renal transplant recipients and usually presents with tubulointerstitial nephritis and occasional ureteric stenosis. Most centers monitor patients with periodic BK- PCR or acute organ dysfunction up to a few years post transplantation. Kidney biopsy usually shows the characteristic findings for BK involvement, which were not seen in this patient. (Choice C) Herpes simplex reactivation commonly occurs in the first months after solid organ transplantation and may present with oral/genital lesions, esophagitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and encephalitis. This patient's illness is not typical for herpes simplex infection. (Choice D) Tacrolimus toxicity usually presents with acute nephrotoxicity, hypertension, neurotoxicity (eg, tremor), and metabolic disturbances (eg, glucose intolerance). This patient's absence of hypertension and nephrotoxicity makes this less likely. (Choice E) Toxoplasma gondii infection rarely occurs following renal transplantation and presents with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pneumonitis, myocarditis, brain abscess, and chorioretinitis. Absence of these findings in this patient makes Toxoplasma infection less likely. Educational objective: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease commonly occurs in the first few months after solid organ transplantation. Infection is defined as CMV viral isolation, and disease is defined as clinical symptoms (eg, mononucleosis- like syndrome) with organ involvement (eg, hepatitis, colitis, and pneumonitis). Treatment involves immunosuppression reduction and antiviral therapy (eg, ganciclovir) for more severe disease.",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient's recent travel to a tropical area, abrupt onset of systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, myalgias, abdominal and muscle pain), and conjunctival suffusion are consistent with Leptospirosis (hemorrhagic jaundice). Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the spirochete Leptospira interrogans, and is most frequently seen in tropical (Hawaii) and temperate climates. The organism commonly infects both wild and domestic mammals (rodents) and these animals shed the organism in their urine. Humans become infected following contact with infected urine. The severity of illness can range from subclinical to severe. Symptomatic patients present with abrupt- onset systemic and GI symptoms. Physical examination may show muscle tenderness and hepatosplenomegaly. Conjunctival suffusion (redness of the conjunctiva without inflammatory exudates) is characteristic of leptospirosis and is not seen in most other infectious diseases. Diagnosis is made by serologic testing or culture of the organism from blood/urine or CSF. Most cases of leptospirosis are mild and self-limiting. Symptomatic patients are treated with doxycycline or penicillin. (Choice A & D) Alcoholic hepatitis and hepatitis A infection are not associated with conjunctival erythema. (Choice B) Dengue fever can present as a febrile illness associated with headache, retroorbital pain, and marked myalgias and arthralgias. Conjunctival findings are not typical. (Choice C) Ehrlichiosis may present with findings similar to this patient, but it is not usually associated with conjunctival erythema. Educational objective: Leptospirosis should be considered in patients with epidemiologic exposure to Leptospira (e.g., rodent urine) who present with an acute febrile illness. Conjunctival suffusion is a common and specific finding. Appropriate treatment is with doxycycline or penicillin.",

Several of her social friends have been sick, including one who was hospitalized with influenza. The patient received an influenza vaccine 2 months ago and has no history of influenza infection. Medical history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, and ischemic cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. She is a lifetime nonsmoker. Temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min. and respirations are 14/min. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient appears uncomfortable but is in no acute distress. No pharyngeal erythema or tonsillar exudates are present, and there is no cervical lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the lungs reveals no abnormalities. Rapid influenza antigen test is negative, and chest x-ray reveals no infiltrates. The patient asks to go home.

    "choice_c": "Prescribe azithromycin",
    "choice_d": "Prescribe oseltamivir",
    "choice_e": "Provide symptomatic treatment and discharge home",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient who had exposure to an individual with influenza now has acute fever, sore throat, cough, and malaise, raising strong suspicion for influenza infection. Rapid influenza antigen testing cannot be used to rule out infection due to high false-negative rates (pooled sensitivity is only ~65%). Similarly, a history of influenza vaccination does not eliminate the risk of infection; vaccination is protective in only 45%-60% of older individuals, and outbreaks commonly occur even in highly vaccinated populations (eg, assisted living, nursing home). Patients who have influenza symptoms for <48 hours should receive antiviral therapy with oseltamivir or zanamivir to reduce symptom duration and, potentially, the likelihood of influenza-related complications (eg, secondary pneumonia). Antiviral therapy, regardless of symptom duration, is recommended for patients who require hospitalization, have severe or progressive illness, or are at high risk of complications. (Choice A) Although the diagnosis of influenza can be confirmed by reverse transcription PCR or viral culture (the latter takes 48-72 for results and is used less commonly), antiviral treatment should not be delayed for confirmatory testing. (Choice B) This patient with a cough and no tonsillar exudates or cervical lymphadenopathy has only 1 of the Centor criteria (fever), indicating no need for rapid streptococcal antigen testing due to a low likelihood of streptococcal infection. (Choice C) This patient with a normal chest x-ray and a nonproductive cough is unlikely to have community-acquired pneumonia; treatment with azithromycin is not indicated at this time. (Choice E) Symptomatic treatment is indicated for low-risk patients who have had influenza symptoms >48 hours. This patient has had symptoms <48 hours and also has risk factors (ie, advanced age, cardiac disease) for influenza complications; she should receive antiviral therapy. Educational objective: Antiviral treatment (eg, oseltamivir) is recommended for patients with <48 hours of influenza-like symptoms. Those who require hospitalization, have severe or progressive illness, or are at high risk of complications should also receive antiviral therapy regardless of symptom duration. Negative rapid influenza antigen testing or a history of influenza vaccination does not rule out influenza infection.",

On further questioning, he recalls recovering from a transient, non-pruritic rash a few months ago that he attributed to his vitamin E supplement. He works as a corporate attorney serving a large number of customers overseas, and returned from a business trip to Thailand two months ago.

    "choice_d": "Offer course of ibuprofen",
    "choice_e": "Repeat serum RPR in four weeks",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with early neurosyphilis, which can present as various syndromes during any stage of syphilis (summarized in the table). Neurosyphilis begins with CSF invasion and can cause CSF laboratory abnormalities without clinical symptoms. Patients with neurological symptoms should undergo CSF examination. Cerebrospinal fluid with positive VDRL, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and elevated protein confirms the diagnosis. Since cerebrospinal fluid VDRL may be negative in up to 70% of patients, a positive test is helpful for establishing the diagnosis, but a negative test does not rule out neurosyphilis. Aqueous intravenous crystalline penicillin G for 10-14 days is the preferred treatment for neurosyphilis. Patients with a possible penicillin allergy should undergo skin testing and desensitization (in consultation with a specialist) if positive. Patients should also undergo serial CSF analysis 3-6 months after treatment and then every 6 months until the CSF shows a normal WBC count and negative VDRL. Patients failing to achieve this after 2 years require retreatment. (Choice B) Intravenous ceftriaxone is an alternative treatment for neurosyphilis in patients with mild penicillin allergy. Cephalosporins have cross reactivity in penicillin-allergic patients. Thus, administering ceftriaxone is permissible with mild penicillin allergy with careful monitoring; it is not recommended for severe penicillin-allergic patients. (Choice C) Doxycycline is an alternative therapy for primary or secondary syphilis in patients allergic to penicillin. However, it is not preferred for neurosyphilis unless the patient refuses penicillin desensitization or cannot take ceftriaxone or penicillin. (Choice D) Ibuprofen and other supportive therapy can be offered for alleviation of symptoms only, but it should not replace antimicrobial therapy. (Choice E) Repeat serum RPR with normalization can be used as a marker of neurosyphilis treatment success in immunocompetent patients or HIV patients taking anti-retrovirals. However, this patient should first be treated before measuring repeat serum RPR. Educational objective: Penicillin is the drug of choice to treat neurosyphilis, which can present with a variety of syndromes. Patients with a history of penicillin allergy should undergo desensitization in a monitored inpatient setting.",

    "explanation": "This patient has acute onset of fever, myalgias, and rash progression within 24 hours of secondary syphilis treatment with penicillin G. This presentation is most consistent with a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This acute febrile illness is attributed to the release of Treponema pallidum components associated with organism death (eg, lipopolysaccharide, which leads to an abrupt release of inflammatory cytokines). The reaction typically begins within hours of antispirochete therapy administration and is self-limiting, usually resolving within 48 hours. Management consists of supportive care, including intravenous therapy and acetaminophen (which may reduce symptom duration). (Choice B) Corticosteroids are not routinely used in the management of Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. Topical corticosteroids are used for some inflammatory skin conditions (eg, eczema). (Choice C) Doxycycline has activity against T pallidum and is used in cases of severe penicillin allergy. (Choice D) Valacyclovir is used in the management of herpes simplex virus infections, typically associated with vesicular lesions. (Choice E) Vancomycin has activity against gram-positive organisms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that this patient's presentation is consistent with an acute bacterial infection (eg, no hypotension, not acutely ill-appearing). Educational objective: Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction should be considered in patients with an acute febrile illness following treatment for syphilis.

These findings are consistent with Schistosoma haematobium infection. In contrast to acute schistosomiasis syndrome or Katayama fever (more frequent in travelers with no immunity), chronic schistosomiasis most commonly occurs in patients who live in endemic areas or have frequent exposure to contaminated fresh water. Symptoms depend on the infection site (Table). Genitourinary schistosomiasis (due to S haematobium) can present with dysuria, urinary frequency, bladder outlet obstruction, or terminal hematuria. Disease largely occurs due to a granulomatous immune reaction to the deposits of schistosomal eggs in the tissues. In patients from endemic areas, diagnosis is made by identifying and quantifying eggs in the urine or stool; in travelers, serology is best due to lighter disease burden and higher test sensitivity. Chronic infection should be treated with praziquantel. (Choices A and B) Ultrasound and CT can help evaluate features of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis but would likely not be helpful in this patient. Cystoscopy to exclude other causes of hematuria would be necessary if other testing is negative. (Choice C) A peripheral blood smear could help diagnose malaria. Although renal impairment and hemoglobinuria may occur in severe Plasmodium falciparum infection, this patient's presentation is not consistent with severe malaria, which normally presents within a month of exposure. (Choice E) Renal tuberculosis can present with hematuria; however, the diagnostic test of choice is identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the urine via culture or polymerase chain reaction testing. Educational objective: Chronic schistosomiasis most commonly occurs in patients who live in endemic areas or have frequent exposure to contaminated fresh water. Symptoms of genitourinary schistosomiasis include dysuria, urinary frequency, bladder outlet obstruction, and terminal hematuria.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient was diagnosed with secondary syphilis before pregnancy and was treated appropriately with a dose of penicillin G. Repeat nontreponemal serologic testing 6 months later showed a significantly decreased, but still positive, reactive plasma reagin (RPR). There are 3 possible reasons for persistently positive nontreponemal testing: 1. Inadequate or inappropriate treatment (failure of RPR to fall 4-fold within 6-12 months of treatment), 2. Reinfection, 3. Serofast reaction. This patient's titer decreased by over 4-fold, making inadequate treatment unlikely. She has no new symptoms, her partner also was treated appropriately, and she has no new partners, so reinfection is unlikely. In some patients, a low (serofast) titer may remain positive indefinitely after the initial 4-fold decline. The most appropriate strategy is to repeat testing in 6 months to ensure that the titer is stable and not rising, which would suggest reinfection. (Choice A) Intramuscular penicillin is the appropriate treatment for primary, secondary, or latent syphilis. However, this patient was adequately treated for secondary syphilis, experienced an appropriate fall in titers, and has no symptoms or history suggestive of a new infection. (Choices B and C) Intravenous penicillin is the treatment for neurosyphilis, which may explain inadequate treatment in some patients. A lumbar puncture is warranted to establish the diagnosis. However, this patient had no neurologic symptoms and the RPR titer decreased as anticipated. (Choice E) Repeating the specific treponemal test, such as a Treponemal pallidum particle agglutination or fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test, is not indicated as these antibodies usually remain positive for life following infection. Educational objective: In HIV-negative patients treated for syphilis, repeat nontreponemal testing should be performed at 6 and 12 months to document response. A serofast response should be considered in patients who have a 4-fold decrease in titers but a persistently positive, low-level titer despite treatment.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation of abdominal pain, recent history of pneumonia, peripheral eosinophilia, and endemic area for Strongyloides stercoralis suggests strongyloidiasis. The parasite is prevalent in the southeastern United States and Southeast Asia (eg, Laos, Cambodia). Infection usually begins with larvae from infected soil penetrating the human skin through the feet. The larvae then migrate hematogenously into the lungs and up the tracheobronchial tree, where they are swallowed. The larvae enter the intestine and mature into adult worms, which produce eggs that transform into larvae. The larvae are then excreted in feces. The full cycle takes about 3-4 weeks. However, S stercoralis can produce larvae that mature completely in the intestine to complete the entire life cycle within the human host. This leads to autoinfection with a large worm burden and hyperinfection syndrome, usually in immunocompromised individuals. The larvae can disseminate into the lungs, liver, heart, central nervous system, and endocrine glands to cause shock or multiorgan failure. The hyperinfection syndrome can also lead to Gram-negative bacteremia (eg, Escherichia coli) due to hematogenous seeding of organisms from the GI tract. As a result, patients from endemic areas with unexplained Gram-negative bacteremia should be tested for S stercoralis. Patients with strongyloidosis may be asymptomatic or present with intermittent abdominal pain, pulmonary symptoms misdiagnosed as asthma that usually worsen with corticosteroids, and/or cutaneous signs. Diagnosis can be confirmed by larvae detection in stool, but stool studies can often be negative. Serology (ELISA for IgG) can be positive even in patients with negative stool studies. Suspected patients with 2 negative stool samples and serology testing may require duodenal aspiration, the string test (Entero-Test), or empiric treatment with ivermectin (preferred) or albendazole (alternate). (Choice A) Initial evaluation of a patient with mild peripheral eosinophilia (< 1500 cells/µL) should begin with detailed history, examination of stool for ova and parasites, and serologic tests based on exposure and travel to endemic areas. Bone marrow biopsy may be indicated if these tests are negative. (Choice B) Celiac disease may present with diarrhea but usually has evidence of iron deficiency anemia. However, this patient's pulmonary symptoms and eosinophilia make this diagnosis less likely. (Choice C) Helicobacter pylori testing is indicated in patients with dyspepsia, gastric MALT lymphoma, or history of active peptic ulcer disease. (Choice E) GI symptoms are unlikely in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. CT scan usually shows fleeting infiltrates and/or bronchiectasis. Educational objective: Strongyloidiasis should be suspected in patients presenting with peripheral eosinophilia, GI and pulmonary complaints, and exposure to an endemic area. Invasive Strongyloides infection can lead to multiorgan dysfunction and septic shock. Diagnosis includes at least 2 stool samples (often negative), ELISA test for IgG antibody, and/or duodenal aspirate/biopsy. Treatment involves ivermectin or albendazole.",

However, the infection is typically not transmitted in the first 48-72 hours of tick attachment. Infection risk is increased with tick engorgement and/or attachment for > 72 hours. The first step is tick removal, which is best done with tweezers or protected hands by pulling straight up. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in patients meeting all 5 of the criteria (Attached tick is adult or nymphal Ixodes scapularis, tick attached for >= 36 hours or engorged, prophylaxis started within 72 hours of tick removal, local B. burgdorferi infection rate >= 20%, no contraindications to doxycycline), usually with doxycycline 200 mg in a single dose (Choice B). If the patient cannot take (or refuses) doxycycline, most physicians do not advise prophylaxis with another antibiotic; instead, observation is recommended with rapid treatment if EM develops. Patients presenting initially with EM do not require serologic testing and should be treated for Lyme disease with antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, cefuroxime, or amoxicillin). Asymptomatic patients, or those with nonspecific symptoms (e.g., fatigue or myalgias), should not be tested. This patient is asymptomatic, presented > 72 hours after tick removal, and requires no further evaluation at this time. (Choice A) Ceftriaxone is a third generation cephalosporin. It is usually given for second or third stage Lyme disease; however, it is not used for Lyme disease prophylaxis. (Choices C and D) Current guidelines do not recommend serologic testing (i.e., ELISA followed by Western blot) for Lyme disease in asymptomatic patients who report tick bite. IgM antibodies may take 2-6 weeks after infection to appear in the blood; testing in the first 2 weeks may lead to false negatives. Other bacterial infections may cause a false positive ELISA, so testing asymptomatic patients may lead to overtreatment. Educational objective: Asymptomatic patients with tick bites from endemic Lyme disease areas do not require serologic testing. Prophylaxis is recommended in patients who live in endemic areas and have deer tick attachment >= 36 hours. Prophylaxis should be initiated within 72 hours of tick removal. Patients with erythema migrans do not need serologic testing, but they should be treated with doxycycline, cefuroxime, or amoxicillin.",

    "explanation": "The chancre of primary syphilis typically develops at the inoculation site. Although this occurs most commonly on the external genitalia, other sites include the posterior pharynx (as seen in this patient), anus, and vagina. The 1- to 2-cm lesions (teeming with treponemal spirochetes) are classically painless with a nonexudative base and an indurated margin; they are generally associated with nontender bilateral lymphadenopathy. Syphilis testing should be performed given this patient's recent history of oral sex, the potential high infectivity of chancres, and the complication risks of untreated syphilis. For cost-related reasons, many laboratories have switched to using treponemal tests (eg, Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay) before nontreponemal tests (eg, rapid plasma reagin) for diagnosis. (Choice A) Oral ulcers and a positive antinuclear antibody screen can be seen with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), but this patient has no other manifestations of SLE. (Choice B) Herpetic ulcers usually present as multiple painful lesions that typically progress from vesicles. (Choice C) An incisional biopsy would be the appropriate test if squamous cell carcinoma were suspected (eg, persistent lesions). (Choice E) Triamcinolone acetonide is used in the management of aphthous ulcers, which typically present as multiple painful lesions. Educational objective: The chancre of primary syphilis typically develops at the inoculation site (eg, external genitalia, posterior pharynx, anus, vagina).",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The hepatitis A virus (HAV) usually spreads via the fecal-oral route, has an incubation period of 30 days, and can be associated with food borne outbreaks. Unvaccinated adults exposed to household contacts with acute HAV infection are at high risk for HAV infection and should receive postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible (Choice E). Current PEP options include single dose inactivated HAV vaccine or immune globulin (IG). Both HAV vaccine and IG given to healthy individuals (ages 12 months to 40 years) within 14 days of HAV exposure provide similar protection, but the HAV vaccine is usually preferred. The HAV vaccine produces active immunity with longer protection, is more available than IG, and is easier to administer. Immune globulin provides protection against hepatitis A through the passive transfer of anti-HAV antibodies. Immune globulin is preferred in children < 12 months of age and in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., advanced AIDS, chronic liver disease, or those taking immunosuppressive medications), since they are less likely to respond to the HAV vaccine (Choices A and B). This patient's family members are unvaccinated, close contacts of an index case, and would benefit most from HAV PEP. (Choice C) Either the HAV vaccine or IG should be given to the household contacts, but not both. Educational objective: Postexposure prophylaxis for hepatitis A is indicated as soon as possible in all unvaccinated household contacts including adults < age 40 and children > age 12 months. The hepatitis A virus vaccine is preferred over immune globulin in these patients; however, immune globulin is recommended in children < 12 months and immunocompromised individuals.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "This patient who was treated for pyelonephritis has continued flank pain, fever, and leukocytosis, raising suspicion for perinephric abscess. This infection usually develops due to direct extension of pyelonephritis but may also occur secondary to hematologic seeding. Most cases arise in individuals who are pregnant or who have diabetes mellitus or anatomic urinary tract abnormalities. Manifestations of perinephric abscess typically include insidious fever, lumboabdominal pain, malaise, and weight loss. Symptoms of urinary tract infection (eg, dysuria, frequency) are frequently absent. Urine studies often show pyuria but can be normal if the infection is walled off from the urinary system. Diagnosis is usually made by CT scan (preferred) or ultrasound; treatment with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage is generally required. Perinephric abscesses can be complicated by extension into the retroperitoneal space, the subdiaphragmatic space, or the lung (lung abscess, empyema, nephrobronchial fistula). (Choice A) Cholecystitis can occasionally present with right-sided costovertebral angle pain. However, this patient's abnormal urinalysis and recent pyelonephritis make perinephric abscess far more likely. (Choice B) Drug fever can occur during antimicrobial treatment but is often associated with rash and is generally a diagnosis of exclusion. This patient's continued abdominal pain, lack of rash, and abnormal urinalysis make a perinephric abscess more likely. (Choice C) Infective endocarditis can present with a wide range of manifestations, but patients often have fever, evidence of embolic phenomena, cardiac murmur, and valvular vegetations on echocardiogram. This patient with a normal cardiac examination and abnormal urinalysis is more likely to have a perinephric abscess. (Choice E) This patient was treated with an appropriate first-line antimicrobial agent for pyelonephritis (eg. levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Obstructive uropathy and a renal/perinephric abscess should be excluded prior to a consideration of a drug-resistant organism. Educational objective: Patients with pyelonephritis who have continued fever, lumboabdominal pain, and systemic symptoms require evaluation for obstructive uropathy or development of a suppurative urinary tract process (eg, renal or perinephric abscess).",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "This patient was appropriately treated for early Lyme disease with doxycycline. Most patients have complete resolution of symptoms within 2-3 weeks, and treatment failure is extremely rare. However, several patients have had subjective symptoms of headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, and cognitive complaints weeks to months after treatment. This is not due to treatment failure or persistent infection with Borrelia Burgdorferi. Extending antibiotic treatment may temporarily improve fatigue but does not affect the other symptoms, which usually resolve within 6 months of initial treatment (Choice C). Patients without physical or objective findings of Lyme disease (eg, CSF or synovial fluid analysis, leukocytosis, elevated ESR) should be treated with supportive care. (Choice A) Blood cultures are not routinely ordered in a patient with no fever, leukocytosis, or new heart murmurs. (Choice B) IgM ELISA is an appropriate initial work-up for suspected Lyme disease. Positive ELISA results must be confirmed by Western blot. However, this patient was recently diagnosed with Lyme disease and reordering the test would yield no new information as IgM and IgG antibodies remain positive for several months to years after the infection. (Choice D) Lumbar puncture would be indicated if this patient had signs of meningitis, encephalitis, or cranial nerve palsies. However, CSF negative for Lyme antibodies but positive for serum antibodies does not exclude CNS Lyme disease. This patient's fatigue is nonspecific and does not indicate CNS Lyme disease. As a result, he does not require lumbar puncture. Educational objective: Post-Lyme disease syndrome usually presents with myalgias, arthralgias, headaches, and cognitive complaints weeks to months after initial successful treatment. Antibiotics are not indicated for these symptoms, and spontaneous resolution is seen within 6 months of initial treatment.",

    "choice_e": "Staphylococcus aureus",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient who ate at an outdoor cookout developed frequent, small-volume stools several days later, raising strong suspicion for inflammatory diarrhea due to a foodborne illness. Inflammatory diarrhea is usually due to infection with Campylobacter, Shigella, or Salmonella. These pathogens invade the large bowel and result in abrupt-onset, crampy abdominal pain and frequent small-volume diarrhea several days after consumption. Blood and mucus are often (but not always) present in the stool. There may also be an associated febrile prodrome with nausea and vomiting. With the exception of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), most cases of inflammatory diarrhea are mild and self-limited. By contrast, noninflammatory diarrhea is usually due to the ingestion of enterotoxin-producing bacteria. Most cases affect the small bowel and lead to large-volume watery diarrhea with or without nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and bloating. Fever is rarely present. Noninflammatory diarrhea is most commonly due to Clostridium perfringens and enterotoxigenic E coli (Choice B). (Choice C) Norovirus infection typically presents with headache, myalgias, acute-onset vomiting, and diarrhea (nonbloody with loose or watery stools). Symptoms usually resolve within 72 hours with full recovery. (Choice D) EHEC produces Shiga toxin and is typically transmitted by the consumption of undercooked ground beef. Manifestations include hemorrhagic colitis and, in 10%-15% of cases, hemolytic uremic syndrome. This patient had no blood in his stool or rectal vault, making EHEC less likely than Campylobacter. (Choice E) Staphylococcus aureus foodborne illness is due to the ingestion of preformed toxins and presents with sudden-onset nausea and vomiting 1-6 hours after consumption. Diarrhea and fever can occasionally occur. Educational objective: Inflammatory diarrhea usually originates in the large bowel and presents with small-volume, frequent diarrhea; possible febrile prodrome; and possible blood or mucus in the stool. Noninflammatory diarrhea originates in the small bowel and usually presents with large-volume, watery diarrhea. Organisms with preformed toxins typically cause sudden-onset nausea and vomiting 1-6 hours after ingestion without significant diarrhea.",

She was healthy until approximately 3 months ago when she was diagnosed with her first episode of pneumonia and treated with antibiotics. She felt better but had a lingering cough. Three weeks ago, she was admitted to the hospital for another episode of pneumonia and was treated with 10 days of antibiotics. She has lost approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg) in these 3 months.

    "explanation": "This patient's clinical history and presentation is consistent with non-tuberculosis mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease. These infections are most frequently caused by Mycobacterium avium or Mycobacterium intracellulare, which are generally grouped together as Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC). Pulmonary MAC infection frequently occurs in non-HIV patients with underlying lung disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis, COPD, or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), but it can also occur in the absence of prior lung disease (e.g., hot tub lung). MAC is commonly found in the environment (even in the tap water of some US areas), and can present with symptoms similar to tuberculosis (e.g., fever, cough, weight loss). Current guidelines recommend the presence of clinical criteria in addition to microbiological confirmation to diagnose pulmonary MAC disease. Since MAC can contaminate or colonize sputum, confirmation of pulmonary MAC disease requires at least 2 positive sputum cultures. However, M. tuberculosis positive sputum is always pathologic and should be treated. This patient meets the clinical criteria for pulmonary MAC, but has only one positive sputum culture. A repeat sputum sample is needed to establish the diagnosis, and if the repeat sputum is negative, a positive culture from a BAL specimen would then be required. Treatment involves a combination of clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifampin for nodular/bronchiectatic MAC. (Choice A) CT-guided biopsy of the pulmonary nodules is invasive, but may be required if the repeat sputum sample is negative in order to establish a diagnosis. (Choice B) Cyclic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are usually positive in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), but this patient's lack of renal disease makes this unlikely. (Choice C) Isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide are used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can present similarly to this patient's presentation. However, her sputum did not grow M. tuberculosis. (Choice E) Serum angiotensin converting enzyme may be elevated in sarcoidosis, which can be associated with cranial nerve VII palsy. However, this patient's abnormal sputum culture makes this diagnosis less likely. Educational objective: Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) is commonly found in the environment and can contaminate or colonize sputum. The diagnosis of pulmonary MAC infection requires the presence of clinical criteria in addition to microbiological confirmation, with at least 2 positive sputum cultures. Once diagnosis is confirmed, patients are treated with combination therapy of clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifampin.",

    "choice_d": "Human papilloma virus",
    "choice_e": "Klebsiella granulomatis",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient presents with multiple painful genital ulcers. Painful ulcers are more likely due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) or chancroid, both of which usually cause multiple ulcers. Painless ulcers are more common with syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and granuloma inguinale. However, the variation in presentations makes the history and physical examination frequently inaccurate in confirming the clinical diagnosis. In addition, more than one etiologic agent (e.g., herpes and syphilis) can be present concurrently. In the United States, HSV is the most common cause of ulcerative sexually transmitted disease, followed by syphilis. Thus, all patients with genital, anal, or perianal ulcers should be evaluated initially for syphilis (e.g., serology and darkfield microscopy) and herpes (e.g., viral culture and/or serology). Based on these results and the response to therapy, other tests (e.g., chancroid, LGV, biopsy) may be needed to identify the ulcer etiology. HIV testing should also be performed on all persons with these ulcers and/or those with generalized lymphadenopathy who are not known to have HIV infection. (Choice A) Candidal infections commonly occur in warm moist body areas (e.g., axilla, groin) and present with pruritic and burning lesions, sometimes with satellite lesions. This patient's discrete painful lesions make this diagnosis less likely. (Choice B) Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1-3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Lymphogranuloma venereum initially presents with painless ulcers, which usually heal spontaneously. This is followed by regional lymph node suppuration or matting and sinus tract development. This condition is not common in the United States. (Choice D) The human papilloma virus usually presents with transient or permanent warts that sometimes predispose patients to a secondary bacterial cellulitis; however, it usually does not present as painful ulcerated lesions. (Choice E) Klebsiella granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale, which usually presents as a painless ulcer on the penile shaft or perineum. The ulcers can eventually destroy the tissue and cause open, oozing lesions that look like granulation tissue. This condition is quite rare in United States. Educational objective: Genital ulcers are most commonly due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) or syphilis. Syphilis usually causes a single ulcer. Painful genital ulcers are more likely due to HSV or chancroid. Medical history and physical examination are not completely accurate, and all patients should be tested for both HSV and syphilis. Further testing for other pathogens is based on these initial results and the response to therapy.",

    "explanation": "This patient's presentation (erythematous, serpiginous, pruritic skin lesion) after recent travel to the Caribbean clinically resembles cutaneous larva migrans, a hookworm infection usually caused by Ancylostoma braziliense. Cutaneous larva migrans presents most commonly as a skin lesion in travelers returning from the Caribbean, Africa, Southeast Asia, and sometimes Central and South America. Infection is usually due to accidental skin penetration with contaminated soil and subsequent larvae migration. The parasite is commonly found in dog and cat feces, sand and soil in tropical/subtropical areas, and the southwestern United States. Patients may notice a stinging sensation or pruritic erythematous papules at the site of larvae penetration, commonly on the lower extremities. The rash then progresses to a serpiginous reddish-brown lesion as the larvae migrate over a period of 2-3 days. Pulmonary involvement rarely occurs. Diagnosis is usually made clinically by history and physical examination. Treatment involves ivermectin (preferred) or albendazole for symptom relief and reducing the risk of bacterial superinfection. (Choice A) Cutaneous leishmaniasis is due to a protozoan parasite transmitted to humans via sandfly bites. It usually presents as a nonpruritic red papule that forms an ulcer with granulomatous tissue at the base and raised margins. (Choice C) Eumycetoma is a chronic granulomatous fungal disease that usually affects the lower extremity (particularly a single foot). Patients usually present with a single small, hard, painless lump with sinus tracts draining pus or mycotic grains. It eventually involves underlying muscles/bones and can persist for years. (Choice D) Swimmer's itch (Schistosome cercarial dermatitis) is caused by Schistosomatoidea (a water-borne parasitic blood fluke) and usually presents as a pruritic maculopapular rash occurring within hours of exposure to contaminated water. The rash (sometimes vesicles) is usually limited to areas where the body was immersed in water. The nonhuman schistosomes cannot complete development in humans but can cause a more rapid and severe inflammatory response with repeated exposure. Educational objective: Cutaneous larva migrans is the most common skin lesion in travelers to tropical endemic regions. It is due to hookworm larval (usually Ancylostoma braziliense) penetration of the skin with migration and a subsequent serpiginous reddish-brown lesion. Treatment involves ivermectin (preferred) or albendazole for symptom relief and to reduce the risk of bacterial superinfection.",

Several LTBI treatment regimens are available; daily isoniazid (INH) for 9 months is commonly used. Major side effects of INH therapy include: Peripheral neuropathy - can be prevented by pyridoxine supplementation. However, pyridoxine should only be added for those at greatest risk including patients who are pregnant, those who have other conditions associated with neuropathy (eg, diabetes, uremia, alcoholism, HIV), and individuals with seizure disorder. Hepatitis - cannot be prevented with pyridoxine supplementation. Patients should be advised to abstain from alcohol. Liver function tests should be monitored at baseline and every 3 months. INH should be discontinued immediately if serum transaminase levels are > 3 times the normal limit in symptomatic patients or >5 times the normal limit in asymptomatic patients. (Choice A) Patients with positive TB screening who have symptoms or chest x-ray findings concerning for active TB require further evaluation with sputum samples for acid-fast bacillus and mycobacterial culture. This patient has a normal chest x-ray and no symptoms. (Choice C) TST induration >= 5 mm is considered a positive result in close contacts of a known TB case. The 10-mm cut-off is used for recent immigrants from endemic areas, injection drug users, residents/employees of high-risk settings, and those at greater risk for TB reactivation (eg, prolonged glucocorticoid use, leukemia, end-stage renal disease). (Choice D) A positive TST indicates exposure and does not need to be repeated. Close contacts who have a negative initial TST should have a repeat TST done at 8-12 weeks. (Choice E) The combination of rifampin and pyrazinamide was shown to result in severe liver injury and is no longer recommended as treatment. Educational objective: A tuberculin skin test reaction of >= 5 mm is considered positive in a patient with recent exposure to an individual with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Daily isoniazid for 9 months is a common treatment for latent tuberculosis infection; pyridoxine is generally added to prevent isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients who are pregnant, those who have other conditions associated with neuropathy (eg, diabetes, uremia, alcoholism, HIV), and individuals with seizure disorder.",

The patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease for which he receives hemodialysis 3 times a week at a dialysis center. He was hospitalized 3 months ago for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia attributed to a hemodialysis catheter that was then removed. He received pneumococcal and influenza vaccines during that admission. He is allergic to intravenous vancomycin. His temperature is 38.6 C (101.5F), blood pressure is 122/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 104/min and regular. He appears uncomfortable and is coughing persistently. Lung examination reveals coarse crackles at the right lung base. Heart sounds are normal with no murmur. Abdomen is soft and nontender. He has no skin rash. The patient's leukocyte count is 18,000/mm3. Chest x-ray reveals an infiltrate in the right lower lung, which is new compared to the x-ray taken 4 months earlier. Appropriate cultures have been obtained. Which of the following is the best initial antibiotic regimen for this patient?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient with pneumonia (fever, cough, and a new right lung infiltrate) has risk factors for resistant organisms and requires appropriate coverage: He has a known history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and may be colonized with this organism. He has risk factors for pneumonia due to gram-negative organisms (eg, Pseudomonas). These risk factors include: prior antibiotic therapy, recent hospitalization, multiple medical comorbidities (eg, diabetes, alcohol use disorder), immunosuppression, possible aspiration, and pulmonary comorbidities (eg, bronchiectasis). His age (>65), medical comoborbidites, and recent hospitalization also place him at risk for drug- resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other risk factors include immunosuppression, exposure to children in a daycare center, and recent beta-lactam, macrolide, or fluoroquinolone therapy. Given the patient's allergy to vancomycin, linezolid (for coverage of MRSA) and cefepime (for coverage of Pseudomonas and other potentially resistant organisms) would be appropriate. (Choice A) Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are usually appropriate for community-acquired pneumonia therapy but do not have MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage. (Choices C and D) Although daptomycin has activity against MRSA, it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant and should not be used in the treatment of MRSA pneumonia. (Choice E) Meropenem monotherapy would not provide adequate MRSA coverage. Educational objective: For patients with pneumonia who are at risk for Pseudomonas or other resistant pathogens, empiric antibiotic therapy should include an antipseudomonal penicillin/cephalosporin or a carbapenem. In patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, either vancomycin or linezolid should be added. Daptomycin should not be used for pneumonia treatment due to its lack of activity in the lung.",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) is a common AIDS-defining illness and is a major cause of death in patients with untreated AIDS. Prior to the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), 70%-80% of patients with AIDS developed PCP, and approximately one-third of these individuals died from the condition. The vast majority of cases occur in patients with CD4 counts <200/mm3. Chemoprophylaxis against PCP is recommended for all patients with HIV who have CD4 counts <200/mm3. Chemoprophylaxis should also be considered in those with higher CD4 counts who develop oropharyngeal candidiasis (indicating susceptibility to opportunistic infections) or have low CD4 count percentage (<14%). Once-daily, double-strength, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the preferred agent. Alternate medications include dapsone, pentamidine, and clindamycin/primaquine. Prophylaxis can be discontinued when ART improves CD4 counts to >200/mm3 for >3 months, as in this patient. Cessation reduces the risk of drug toxicity/interactions and of developing drug-resistant organisms. (Choice A) Azithromycin prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex is recommended for patients with AIDS who have CD4 counts <50/mm3. (Choice B) Primary chemoprophylaxis against coccidiomycosis is not recommended for HIV-positive patients. However, patients who live in or travel to endemic regions can be screened for exposure with twice-annual serologic testing. Those who become seropositive and have CD4 counts <250/mm3 are generally given fluconazole prophylaxis if no disease manifestations are present. (Choice D) Beclomethasone has stabilized this patient's asthma, and stopping the drug would likely worsen her condition. This drug has minimal interactions with ART and TMP-SMX. Educational objective: Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia is recommended for patients with AIDS who have CD4 counts <200/mm3. Prophylaxis can be safely discontinued in patients on antiretroviral therapy who have CD4 counts >200/mm3 for >3 months.",

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "With this patient's poorly controlled HIV status, marked body cavity lymphadenopathy, and bone lucency, the most likely underlying cause is non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Around 4% of HIV patients have lymphoma at the time of diagnosis with the same percentage developing lymphoma during their disease course. Factors that contribute to the incidence include direct effects of HIV, immunosuppressive state, co- infection with other oncogenic viruses (eg, Epstein-Barr), and environmental oncogenic stimuli. HAART prevents severe immunosuppression, which in turn helps to decrease the incidence of NHL. Patients with NHL tend to present with B symptoms (fever, weight loss, and night sweats), extranodal disease, and involvement of unusual locations (eg, body cavity, rectum, and soft tissue). Rarely, they may present with fever of unknown origin. Diffuse large-cell NHL and Burkitt lymphoma are the most common AIDS-related lymphomas. (Choice A) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is not associated with HIV infection and the blood count differential shows predominantly mature-appearing lymphocytes. (Choice B) Fungal infections such as blastomycosis and histoplasmosis can involve bone. However, this patient's bulky lymphadenopathy is more suggestive of a lymphoma. (Choice C) Kaposi sarcoma usually presents with skin lesions (purplish, reddish blue, or dark brown/black) on the lower extremities, often associated with lymphedema. Lymph node involvement occurs infrequently. (Choice D) Although myeloma can cause bone lesions, it does not cause bulky lymphadenopathy and severe B symptoms. Educational objective: AIDS-related lymphomas are common in patients with advanced HIV, a low CD4 count (<100/μL), high HIV viral load, and a prior diagnosis of AIDS. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) tend to present with B symptoms, extranodal disease, and involvement of unusual locations. Diffuse large-cell NHL and Burkitt lymphoma are the most common AIDS-related lymphomas.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's increased knee pain and swelling 3 months after arthroplasty is concerning for either aseptic mechanical complication of the prosthesis or early-onset prosthetic joint infection (PJI). Mechanical complications typically present with pain associated with weight bearing or activity. PJI often presents with persistent pain and other localized or systemic symptoms of infection (eg, joint effusion, wound drainage, fever, erythema, induration, edema). PJI can present as early (< 3 months), delayed (3-12 months), or late onset (> 12 months) after surgery. Although plain films can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of PJI, the sensitivity and specificity of x- ray findings are limited. The absence of x-ray findings should not deter further consideration of PJI in the appropriate setting. Diagnostic arthrocentesis should be performed in patients with suspected PJI unless open surgical drainage is anticipated or an obvious sign of infection, such as a sinus tract, is present. Synovial fluid analysis should include a cell count and differential and Gram stain and culture for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein can be useful adjunctive tests in establishing the diagnosis. Blood cultures should also be performed. Early-onset PJI usually improves with surgical debridement followed by prolonged antibiotics. Delayed and late onset may also require prosthesis removal if debridement shows an infected prosthesis. (Choice B) Unless there are clear signs of sepsis, the use of antibiotics should follow arthrocentesis to maximize the yield of synovial fluid culture and direct antibiotic therapy. This patient appears clinically stable and should first undergo arthrocentesis. (Choice C) MRI can be done only in patients with titanium or tantalum prostheses but is still not as sensitive as arthrocentesis. (Choice D) Naproxen with close follow-up is indicated for symptomatic relief in noninfectious causes of joint pain (eg, bursitis). Although naproxen may also help this patient's symptoms, he should first undergo arthrocentesis to evaluate for PJI. (Choice E) Technetium 99m colloid bone scan is nonspecific and may show high false-positive results in the early months after prosthetic joint implantation due to periprosthetic bone remodeling. Educational objective: Prosthetic joint infection should be considered in patients with increasing pain after joint replacement. Arthrocentesis establishes the diagnosis. Treatment involves surgical debridement (or removal in delayed or late-onset cases) followed by a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This asymptomatic patient presents with a PPD/TST showing only 2 mm induration and 20 mm of erythema. The induration (not erythema) is used to assess reaction, and a >= 10 mm increase within a 2- year period is considered a positive test. The significance of overall induration size depends on patient risk factors (summarized in the table). This patient has no obvious TB risk factors, but he is in a higher risk population (diabetes). However, his TST is <5 mm induration and is not considered significant. As a result, he needs no further treatment or evaluation for latent TB at this time. Patients with a positive TST should undergo chest x-ray to evaluate for active pulmonary disease (Choice A). Patients with abnormal radiographic findings should be treated with an appropriate regimen and monitoring of cultures. Patients with a normal chest x-ray can be treated for latent TB (e.g., 3 months of INH plus rifapentine or 6-9 months of INH with vitamin B6 with monitoring of liver function tests (Choice D). (Choice C) Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are not affected by Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination status. Quantiferon-TB test (QFT) is one type of IGRA and is preferred in patients with a history of BCG vaccination in whom there is difficulty in interpreting TST results. Educational objective: PPD/TST assesses for latent TB and a positive reaction is based on induration (rather than erythema) and patient risk factors. A positive test requires chest x-ray to rule out active infection. Patients with a negative chest x-ray should be treated with an appropriate regimen in addition to laboratory monitoring.",

Patients can remain asymptomatic for several years or develop symptoms of heart failure. Echocardiogram shows varying degrees of right and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction, along with left ventricular apical aneurysm, which is considered pathognomonic of Chagas cardiomyopathy. (Choice A) Blastomycosis is a systemic granulomatous infection usually involving the lungs that causes acute or chronic pneumonia.

P jirovecii prophylaxis is recommended for patients with HIV who have CD4 counts <200/mm3 or evidence of thrush. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the preferred first-line agent; dapsone, atovaquone, or pentamidine are second-line options for those who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX. Testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is required prior to the initiation of dapsone. T gondii prophylaxis is required for patients who have CD4 counts <100/mm3 and positive IgG serology. TMP-SMX is the preferred agent but second-line therapies are available (as shown in the table). Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis with azithromycin (1,200 mg weekly) or clarithromycin is required for patients with CD4 counts <50/mm3. Cryptococcus primary prophylaxis is not recommended.

Acute HIV presents with \"flu-like\" symptoms, including fever, headache, fatigue, sore throat, nausea, diarrhea, and enlarged lymph nodes. Sore throat may be persistent and is often mistaken for other viral illnesses. The rash is macular with some papular features and typically appears on the trunk and face. The appearance of a rash signifies seroconversion, so HIV testing at this point is appropriate. (Choice A) Sore throat would be a very unusual extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease, making this diagnosis unlikely. (Choice B) Gonococcal pharyngitis usually presents in association with genitourinary symptoms but can also occur by itself. The rash associated with disseminated gonococcal infection is commonly associated with joint or tendon pain, is more peripheral (rather than truncal), and varies from maculopapular to pustular. This patient's lack of joint pain or genitourinary symptoms makes gonorrhea unlikely. (Choice D) Infectious mononucleosis typically presents in patients age <21 and can cause a sore throat with malaise and lymphadenopathy. Rash is seen in <5% of patients, but it is almost always (>70%) seen if the \"cillin\" antibiotics are given. (Choice E) Infectious diarrhea caused by toxin-mediated bacteria such as Escherichia coli can lead to complications such as hemolytic uremic syndrome. However, these patients do not typically have a sore throat and macular rash. Educational objective: HIV may present in its acute phase as a flu-like illness and as a cause of persistent sore throat. When a rash is present, HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing is sensitive with a lower rate of false negatives.",

    "explanation": "This patient was recently diagnosed with HIV and started on antiretroviral therapy (ART). He now likely has immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) due to previously undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB). IRIS is characterized by paradoxical worsening of a preexisting chronic infection or unmasking of an unrecognized infection due to immune system recovery during the treatment of HIV. Patients usually develop IRIS within a few weeks or months of ART initiation. Most cases arise in patients with pretreatment CD4 counts of <100/mm3. Severity is usually greatest in those with high pretreatment HIV RNA levels who have a strong virologic (rapid decline in HIV RNA) and immunologic (rapid rise in CD4 count) response to therapy. Because IRIS is a diagnosis of exclusion, other conditions (eg, bacterial superinfection, drug allergy/toxicity, patient noncompliance) must be considered. Several opportunistic infections have been associated with IRIS, including: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis B and C, Herpes simplex virus, Human herpes virus 8, John Cunningham polyomavirus, Pneumocystis. IRIS is typically self-limited and is primarily addressed by treating the underlying infection. ART can usually be continued without interruption, but patients who develop life-threatening complications (eg, airway obstruction due to an expanding inflammatory mass) often have to transiently stop ART (Choice C). Corticosteroids are generally not indicated but can be added for patients with severe or life-threatening symptoms (eg, obstructive mass lesions) (Choice D). (Choice A) The patient had an indeterminate interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and now has manifestations (eg, cough, upper lobe infiltrate) of active TB infection; as a result, symptomatic care alone is inappropriate. He should undergo sputum testing for acid-fast bacilli and culture to establish a microbial diagnosis. (Choice E) Patients with HIV who have low CD4 counts are more likely to have indeterminate IGRA testing; therefore, IGRA is often repeated when CD4 counts improve. However, this patient now has symptoms and chest x-ray findings consistent with active TB; as a result, additional latent TB screening (with repeat IGRA) would not be indicated at this time. He should undergo sputum testing to establish a microbial diagnosis. Educational objective: Patients with HIV who have low CD4 counts (usually <100/mm3 and high pretreatment HIV RNA levels are at greatest risk for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, which is characterized by paradoxical worsening of a preexisting chronic infection or unmasking of an unrecognized infection within weeks or a few months of antiretroviral initiation. Treatment is generally focused on the underlying infection; antiretroviral therapy (ART) can usually be continued without interruption. However, patients with severe or life-threatening complications may require the temporary cessation of ART and/or the addition of corticosteroids.",

    "stem": "A 27-year-old man comes to the office to discuss HIV prevention. One of his sexual partners is an HIV- positive man who intermittently adheres to antiretroviral therapy, and the patient also has sexual encounters with men of unknown HIV status. The patient does not reliably use condoms due to loss of sensation during intercourse. He is concerned about his risk of HIV infection and is interested in the use of antiretroviral therapy or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent contracting the disease. The patient has had no recent fever, weight loss, rash, or malaise. He was diagnosed with gonococcal urethritis 3 months ago and was treated with antibiotics; he has no other medical history. The patient occasionally uses intranasal cocaine prior to intercourse and drinks a few beers on weekends. He does not use tobacco or injection drugs. The patient's vital signs are within normal parameters, and physical examination is significant only for diffuse tattoos over the upper extremities. Serum chemistry is normal, and viral hepatitis screening is positive for hepatitis C IgG antibody alone. HIV testing is negative. After careful discussion about safe sex practices, which of the following is the most appropriate next step regarding PrEP use in this patient?",
    "choice_a": "Advise against PrEP due to history of hepatitis C",
    "choice_b": "Advise against PrEP due to illicit drug use",
    "choice_c": "Advise against PrEP due to multiple sexual partners",
    "choice_d": "Recommend PrEP using 2-drug regimen",
    "choice_e": "Recommend PrEP using 3-drug regimen",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can reduce the risk of HIV acquisition by >90% and is generally offered to those at substantial risk for new HIV infection due to: Sexual behaviors - HIV-positive partner with detectable viral load; men who have sex with men and individuals from high prevalence areas (eg, sub-Saharan Africa) with recent bacterial sexually transmitted infection, sex exchange for money, inconsistent condom use, or high number of partners; Injection drug use - HIV-positive injecting partner; sharing of injecting equipment. Treatment includes the use of once-daily 2-drug antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir plus emtricitabine. Two-drug therapy would incompletely treat active HIV infections, which can lead to drug resistance; therefore, to qualify for PrEP, patients must have negative fourth-generation HIV testing and no manifestations of acute HIV. Normal renal function and documented hepatitis B infection/vaccination status is also required. As hepatitis B can also be treated with tenofovir, patients with chronic hepatitis B infections can sometimes undergo combined hepatitis B and PrEP treatment. Patients on PrEP require follow-up every 3 months for HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, and medication adherence/side-effect assessment. Regular creatinine levels and screening for bacterial sexually transmitted infections is also recommended. (Choice A) Direct-acting antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis C does not usually interfere with the administration of PrEP. (Choices B and C) Multiple sexual partners and injection drug use are indications, not contraindications, for the use of PrEP. (Choice E) Three-drug antiretroviral therapy is required to treat an active HIV infection but is not used for PrEP. Educational objective: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a once-daily 2-drug antiretroviral regimen (tenofovir plus emtricitabine) can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV by >90%. PrEP is generally offered to those at substantial risk of new HIV infection due to sexual behaviors (eg, HIV-positive partner, inconsistent/no condom use) or injection drug use. To qualify, patients must have negative fourth-generation HIV testing, no manifestations of acute HIV, normal renal function, and documented hepatitis B infection/vaccination status.",

    "stem": "A 19-year-old woman comes to the physician with a 1-week history of malaise and joint pains. She also has mild shortness of breath. The patient initially developed left elbow pain and swelling but now has pain in the right knee and ankle. She emigrated from Thailand 6 months ago and has resided with family members in New York City, none of whom have been ill. Her temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 104/64 mm Hg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 20/min Lungs are clear bilaterally. Cardiac examination reveals a blowing 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex. The right knee and left elbow are mildly swollen and tender. There are palpable subcutaneous nodules on the extensor surface of both arms. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 100 mm/hr and blood cultures are negative. Which of the following is most useful in confirming the diagnosis?",
    "choice_a": "Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies",
    "choice_b": "Antinuclear antibody screen",
    "choice_c": "Antistreptolysin O antibody titers",
    "choice_d": "Rheumatoid factor",
    "choice_e": "Right knee aspiration",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's history (recent emigration) and presentation with fever, arthralgias, migratory arthritis, subcutaneous nodules, mitral regurgitation murmur, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are suggestive of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Rheumatic fever occurs 2-4 weeks after pharyngeal infection with group A -hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS). ARF is a clinical diagnosis that is typically made using the Jones criteria (Table). Evaluation includes assessment of cardiac function and acute phase reactants (ESR and C-reactive protein) along with one of the following studies to establish GAS infection: Positive throat culture for GAS (negative in 75% of patients with ARF), Positive rapid streptococcal antigen test, Elevated or rising antistreptolysin O (ASO) antibody titer. Diagnosis of ARF is based on evidence of GAS infection and 2 major (or 1 major and 2 minor) manifestations of the Jones criteria. Patients must be treated with a full course of antibiotics to eradicate GAS carriage regardless of the presence of pharyngitis at the time of diagnosis. They are also at high risk for recurrence and progression of rheumatic heart disease with repeated episodes of GAS pharyngitis. Therefore, these patients must be treated with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrent pharyngitis and limit progression of rheumatic heart disease. (Choice A) Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, also known as Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Churg- Strauss syndrome, and renal-limited vasculitis. Patients with GPA or MPA are typically older and have constitutional symptoms, leukocytoclastic angiitis, and pulmonary-renal complications. Cardiac valves are not typically involved. (Choices B and D) Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and rheumatoid factor are used to screen for systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other rheumatologic autoimmune diseases. Patients may have constitutional and musculoskeletal symptoms as in this patient, but cardiac valves are not typically involved. (Choice E) Knee aspiration for synovial fluid analysis is indicated in patients with suspected septic arthritis or crystal induced synovitis. These conditions usually cause a severe monoarthritis, rather than the migratory polyarthritis seen in this patient. Educational objective: Acute rheumatic fever is characterized by fever, migratory arthritis, subcutaneous nodules, carditis/valvular heart disease, and elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein). It is diagnosed clinically based on the Jones criteria in conjunction with confirmation of group A Streptococcal infection.",

    "stem": "A 68-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease comes to the physician due to fever and malaise. He developed abrupt-onset fever, headache, nonproductive cough, severe body aches, and generalized weakness about 24 hours ago. He has a 43-year history of smoking but quit 2 years ago. His medications include tiotropium daily and albuterol as needed. The patient has no other medical problems. He visited his grandchildren a week ago during Christmas and reports that his 6-year-old grandson was sick with similar symptoms. His temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 124/84 mm Hg, pulse is 96/min, and respirations are 18/min. Pulmonary auscultation shows decreased breath sounds bilaterally but no focal crackles. Chest x-ray shows flat hemidiaphragms bilaterally but no focal infiltrate. A rapid influenza antigen test is negative. Laboratory results are as follows: Leukocytes 12,800/mm3 Differential: Neutrophils 80%, Eosinophils 3%, Lymphocytes 15%, Monocytes 2%. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment at this time?",
    "choice_a": "Amantadine",
    "choice_b": "Oseltamivir",
    "choice_c": "Ribavirin",
    "choice_d": "Symptomatic therapy (eg, acetaminophen) only",
    "choice_e": "Zanamivir",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In this patient with an influenza-like illness (fever plus cough and/or sore throat), the clinical suspicion for influenza is high (winter season, abrupt symptom onset, sick contact). In addition, the patient's age (265) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) place him at high risk of influenza complications (Table). Early antiviral therapy may decrease symptom duration, illness severity, and complication rates, particularly in high-risk patients and those with severe disease. Because this high-risk patient is within the first 48 hours of symptom onset, a neuraminidase inhibitor such as oseltamivir or zanamivir is recommended, rather than symptomatic therapy alone (Choice D). However, zanamivir should be avoided in patients with chronic pulmonary disease (eg, COPD, asthma) as it can precipitate bronchospasm and respiratory function decline (Choice E). Although diagnostic testing for influenza is recommended in immunocompromised or high-risk immunocompetent patients with influenza-like illness, treatment should not be delayed pending results availability. It also should not be stopped due to a negative rapid antigen test result in patients in whom suspicion for influenza is high (as in this patient) due to the test's low sensitivity (40%-60%) in diagnosing influenza. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (more sensitive but less readily available) is preferred and should be performed for confirmation if available. (Choice A) Adamantanes (eg, amantadine, rimantadine) are effective against some influenza A viruses but are not currently recommended due to high drug resistance. (Choice C) Ribavirin is used to treat immunosuppressed patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); it is not effective against influenza. Educational objective: Antiviral therapy is recommended for patients at high risk for influenza complications, particularly within the first 48 hours after symptom onset. In the absence of suspected resistance, oseltamivir is the treatment of choice for patients with suspected influenza infection with underlying pulmonary disease.",
